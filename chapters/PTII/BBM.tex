\chapter{BioBackgroundModels.jl: Parallel training of Hidden Markov Model zoos of genomic background noise in Julia}
\label{ch:BBM}

\path{BioBackgroundModels.jl} is a pure Julia package intended to automate the optimization and selection of large numbers ("zoos") of Hidden Markov Models, using sequence sampled from specified partitions of a given genome, on arbitrary collections of hardware. It is supplied with extensive utility functions for genomic sampling, high performance implementations of both the Baum-Welch and Churbanov-Winters algorithms for optimization of HMMs by expectation maximization (EM), as well as reporting functions for summarizing the results of the optimized model "zoos". These tasks are necessary to select of models of genomic background noise, from which motif signals may be detected using a package such as \path{BioMotifInference.jl}.
