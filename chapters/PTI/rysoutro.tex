\chapter{Implications of rys}
\label{chap:rysoutro}

\section{Separability of cell cycle and specification}
practical import of this is high- compare the conflation of Harris models to possible model framework which separates and modulates these independently for eg. transplants
\section{Frontiers of nuclear dynamics}
discuss recent experiments measuring chromatin conformation, pulsatile transcription etc
\section{Integrating nuclear dynamics into models of CMZ- abstraction and biosemiotics}
abstraction necessary due to computational limits, biosemiotics allow for the calibration of this theoretically
