\chapter{Inferring and modelling nuclear dynamics in retinal progenitors}
\label{chap:rysintro}

\section{Intro}
transition from discussion of modelling postembryonic CMZ and using nuclear shape to infer identity for modelling purposes to discussion of the implication of the correlations of nuclear state, cellular identity, and cellular function

\section{Frontiers of nuclear dynamics}
discuss recent experiments measuring chromatin conformation, pulsatile transcription etc
\section{Integrating nuclear dynamics into models of CMZ- abstraction and biosemiotics}
abstraction necessary due to computational limits, biosemiotics allow for the calibration of this theoretically
