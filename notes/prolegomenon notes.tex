From the practicioner's perspective, we are interested in thinking about the "metaphysical unit" of scientific practice on a finer scale than allowed by Feyerabend's concept of a tradition. If we take the practice of molecular biology to be about generating explanations for biological phenomena in terms of macromolecules, we want to know enough about the structure of these explanations to allow us to compare them. While we all already know that we are looking for the "underlying molecular mechanisms" of (usually) cellular phenomena, it is not always clear how we might go beyond intuitive preferences for one proposed mechanism or another in, say, deciding what assay to perform next. We may reason in terms of plausibility or agreement with evidence, but we rarely do so formally\footnote{.
