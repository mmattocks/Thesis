  abstract = {In recent decades the expression "molecular biology" has progressively disappeared from journals, and no longer designates new chairs or departments. This begs the question: does it mean that molecular biology is dead, and has been displaced by new emerging disciplines such as systems biology and synthetic biology? Maybe its reductionist approach to living phenomena has been substituted by one that is more holistic. The situation, undoubtedly, is far less simple. To appreciate better what has happened it is necessary to acknowledge the following: the intial project of molecular biologists was not a reductionist one, but an attempt to naturalize the phenomena of life by using the epistemological principles of physics as a model; and, it is necessary to distinguish the early stages of molecular biology, and the later aggregating process which gave it its present characteristics. Only one of these characteristics, the importance of the informational vision, has been seriously challenged in recent years. But it is obvious that the ambition of most early molecular biologists to discover simple rules and principles explaining all of biological facts has vanished. The pendulum has now moved toward the study of the diversity generated by a long evolutionary history.},

One reason is that physical approaches to the phenomena of life have frequently been conceived by their authors as alternatives to biological explanations. My argument is that molecular descriptions and explanations have been pushed so far that they have reached their limits: these limits constitute a favourable niche in which physical explanations can develop. I will focus on the field of molecular and cell biology and give many examples of these recent physical studies made possible by the precision of molecular observations. The nature of these niches is probably diverse. I consider that it is too early to have a global view of the interactions between biological and physical explanations, and to organize them into different categories. Such interactions are not new within the life sciences: the history of biology reveals a complex, permanently moving landscape of interactions between biological and physical explanations.},

  abstract = {The concept of life forms emerging from inanimate matter - spontaneous generation - was widely accepted until the nineteenth century. Several medieval Jewish scholars acknowledged this scientific theory in their philosophical and religious contemplations. Quite interestingly, it served to reinforce diverse, or even opposite, theological conclusions. One approach excluded spontaneously-generated living beings form the biblical account of creation or the story of the Deluge. Underlying this view is an understanding that organisms that generate spontaneously evolve continuously in nature and, therefore, do not require divine intervention in their formation or survival during disastrous events. This naturalistic position reduces the miraculous dimension of reality. Others were of the opinion that spontaneous generation is one of the extraordinary marvels exhibited in this world and, accordingly, this interpretation served to accentuate the divine aspect of nature. References to spontaneous generation also appear in legal writings, influencing practical applications such as dietary laws and actions forbidden on the Sabbath.},

  abstract = {Pluripotent stem cells can self-renew in culture and differentiate along all somatic lineages in~vivo. While much is known about the molecular basis of pluripotency, the mechanisms of differentiation remain unclear. Here, we profile individual mouse embryonic stem cells as they progress along the neuronal lineage. We observe that cells pass from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state via an intermediate epiblast-like state. However, analysis of the rate at which cells enter and exit these observed cell states using a hidden Markov model indicates the presence of a chain of unobserved molecular states that each cell transits through stochastically in sequence. This chain of hidden states allows individual cells to~record their position on the differentiation trajectory, thereby encoding a simple form of cellular memory. We suggest a statistical mechanics interpretation of these results that distinguishes between functionally distinct cellular ``macrostates'' and functionally similar molecular ``microstates'' and propose a model of stem cell differentiation as a non-Markov stochastic process.,

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal balancing of cellular proliferation and differentiation is crucial for postnatal tissue homoeostasis and organogenesis. During embryonic development, pancreatic progenitors simultaneously proliferate and differentiate into the endocrine, ductal and acinar lineages. Using in vivo clonal analysis in the founder population of the pancreas here we reveal highly heterogeneous contribution of single progenitors to organ formation. While some progenitors are bona fide multipotent and contribute progeny to all major pancreatic cell lineages, we also identify numerous unipotent endocrine and ducto-endocrine bipotent clones. Single-cell transcriptional profiling at E9.5 reveals that endocrine-committed cells are molecularly distinct, whereas multipotent and bipotent progenitors do not exhibit different expression profiles. Clone size and composition support a probabilistic model of cell fate allocation and in silico simulations predict a transient wave of acinar differentiation around E11.5, while endocrine differentiation is proportionally decreased. Increased proliferative capacity of outer progenitors is further proposed to impact clonal expansion., The pancreas arises from a small population of cells but how individual cells contribute to organ formation is unclear. Here, the authors deconstruct pancreas organogenesis into clonal units, showing that single progenitors give rise to heterogeneous multi-lineage and endocrinogenic single-lineage clones.},

  abstract = {The proper functioning of multicellular organisms requires the robust establishment of precise proportions between distinct cell-types. This developmental differentiation process typically involves intracellular regulatory and stochastic mechanisms to generate cell-fate diversity as well as intercellular mechanisms to coordinate cell-fate decisions at tissue level. We thus surmise that key insights about the developmental regulation of cell-type proportion can be captured by the modeling study of clustering dynamics in population of inhibitory-coupled noisy bistable systems. This general class of dynamical system is shown to exhibit a very stable two-cluster state, but also frustrated relaxation, collective oscillations or steady-state hopping which prevents from timely and reliably reaching a robust and well-proportioned clustered state. To circumvent these obstacles or to avoid fine-tuning, we highlight a general strategy based on dual-time positive feedback loops, such as mediated through transcriptional versus epigenetic mechanisms, which improves proportion regulation by coordinating early and flexible lineage priming with late and firm commitment. This result sheds new light on the respective and cooperative roles of multiple regulatory feedback, stochasticity and lateral inhibition in developmental dynamics.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {1544-9173},
  abstract = {In some recent studies, a view emerged that stochastic dynamics governing the switching of cells from one differentiation state to another could be characterized by a peak in gene expression variability at the point of fate commitment. We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data, single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability, which was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition, we also identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation. In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and its evolution in time, we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of the differentiation process, reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h, before decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover, we observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion, when analyzed at the single cell level, the differentiation process looks very different from its classical population average view. New observables (like entropy) can be computed, the behavior of which is fully compatible with the idea that differentiation is not a ``simple'' program that all cells execute identically but results from the dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network., A single-cell transcriptomics analysis offers a new dynamical view of the differentiation process, involving an increase in between-cell variability prior to commitment., The differentiation process has classically been seen as a stereotyped program leading from one progenitor toward a functional cell. This vision was based upon cell population-based analyses averaged over millions of cells. However, new methods have recently emerged that allow interrogation of the molecular content at the single-cell level, challenging this view with a new model suggesting that cell-to-cell gene expression stochasticity could play a key role in differentiation. We took advantage of a physiologically relevant avian cellular model to analyze the expression level of 92 genes in individual cells collected at several time-points during differentiation. We first observed that the process analyzed at the single-cell level is very different and much less well ordered than the population-based average view. Furthermore, we showed that cell-to-cell variability in gene expression peaks transiently before strongly decreasing. This rise in variability precedes two key events: an irreversible commitment to differentiation, followed by a significant increase in cell size variability. Altogether, our results support the idea that differentiation is not a ``simple'' series of well-ordered molecular events executed identically by all cells in a population but likely results from dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.},

  title = {A Mathematical Model of Mechanotransduction Reveals How Mechanical Memory Regulates Mesenchymal Stem Cell Fate Decisions},
  volume = {11},
  issn = {1752-0509},
  abstract = {Background
Mechanical and biophysical properties of the cellular microenvironment regulate cell fate decisions. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fate is influenced by past mechanical dosing (memory), but the mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been well defined. We have yet to understand how memory affects specific cell fate decisions, such as the differentiation of MSCs into neurons, adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts.

Results
We study a minimal gene regulatory network permissive of multi-lineage MSC differentiation into four cell fates. We present a continuous model that is able to describe the cell fate transitions that occur during differentiation, and analyze its dynamics with tools from multistability, bifurcation, and cell fate landscape analysis, and via stochastic simulation. Whereas experimentally, memory has only been observed during osteogenic differentiation, this model predicts that memory regions can exist for each of the four MSC-derived cell lineages. We can predict the substrate stiffness ranges over which memory drives differentiation; these are directly testable in an experimental setting. Furthermore, we quantitatively predict how substrate stiffness and culture duration co-regulate the fate of a stem cell, and we find that the feedbacks from the differentiating MSC onto its substrate are critical to preserve mechanical memory. Strikingly, we show that re-seeding MSCs onto a sufficiently soft substrate increases the number of cell fates accessible.

Conclusions
Control of MSC differentiation is crucial for the success of much-lauded regenerative therapies based on MSCs. We have predicted new memory regions that will directly impact this control, and have quantified the size of the memory region for osteoblasts, as well as the co-regulatory effects on cell fates of substrate stiffness and culture duration. Taken together, these results can be used to develop novel strategies to better control the fates of MSCs in vitro and following transplantation.

  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Identifying the exact regulatory circuits that can stably maintain tissue homeostasis is critical for our basic understanding of multicellular organisms, and equally critical for identifying how tumors circumvent this regulation, thus providing targets for treatment. Despite great strides in the understanding of the molecular components of stem-cell regulation, the overall mechanisms orchestrating tissue homeostasis are still far from being understood. Typically, tissue contains the stem cells, transit amplifying cells, and terminally differentiated cells. Each of these cell types can potentially secrete regulatory factors and/or respond to factors secreted by other types. The feedback can be positive or negative in nature. This gives rise to a bewildering array of possible mechanisms that drive tissue regulation. In this paper, we propose a novel method of studying stem cell lineage regulation, and identify possible numbers, types, and directions of control loops that are compatible with stability, keep the variance low, and possess a certain degree of robustness. For example, there are exactly two minimal (two-loop) control networks that can regulate two-compartment (stem and differentiated cell) tissues, and 20 such networks in three-compartment tissues. If division and differentiation decisions are coupled, then there must be a negative control loop regulating divisions of stem cells (e.g. by means of contact inhibition). While this mechanism is associated with the highest robustness, there could be systems that maintain stability by means of positive divisions control, coupled with specific types of differentiation control. Some of the control mechanisms that we find have been proposed before, but most of them are new, and we describe evidence for their existence in data that have been previously published. By specifying the types of feedback interactions that can maintain homeostasis, our mathematical analysis can be used as a guide to experimentally zero in on the exact molecular mechanisms in specific tissues.},

  shorttitle = {Processes on the Emergent Landscapes of Biochemical Reaction Networks and Heterogeneous Cell Population Dynamics},
  abstract = {The notion of an attractor has been widely employed in thinking about the nonlinear dynamics of organisms and biological phenomena as systems and as processes. The notion of a landscape with valleys and mountains encoding multiple attractors, however, has a rigorous foundation only for closed, thermodynamically non-driven, chemical systems, such as a protein. Recent advances in the theory of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems and its applications to mesoscopic reaction networks, one reaction at a time, have provided a new basis for a landscape of open, driven biochemical reaction systems under sustained chemostat. The theory is equally applicable not only to intracellular dynamics of biochemical regulatory networks within an individual cell but also to tissue dynamics of heterogeneous interacting cell populations. The landscape for an individual cell, applicable to a population of isogenic non-interacting cells under the same environmental conditions, is defined on the counting space of intracellular chemical compositions x = (x1,x2, \ldots{} ,xN) in a cell, where x{$\mathscr{l}$} is the concentration of the {$\mathscr{l}$}th biochemical species. Equivalently, for heterogeneous cell population dynamics x{$\mathscr{l}$} is the number density of cells of the {$\mathscr{l}$}th cell type. One of the insights derived from the landscape perspective is that the life history of an individual organism, which occurs on the hillsides of a landscape, is nearly deterministic and `programmed', while population-wise an asynchronous non-equilibrium steady state resides mostly in the lowlands of the landscape. We argue that a dynamic `blue-sky' bifurcation, as a representation of Waddington's landscape, is a more robust mechanism for a cell fate decision and subsequent differentiation than the widely pictured pitch-fork bifurcation. We revisit, in terms of the chemostatic driving forces upon active, living matter, the notions of near-equilibrium thermodynamic branches versus far-from-equilibrium states. The emergent landscape perspective permits a quantitative discussion of a wide range of biological phenomena as nonlinear, stochastic dynamics.},

  abstract = {Phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may be a manifestation of ``gene expression noise''\textendash, or it may reflect stable phenotypic variants. Such ``non-genetic cell individuality'' can arise from the slow fluctuations of protein levels in mammalian cells. These fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality, thereby rendering a clonal population heterogeneous. However, it remains unknown whether this heterogeneity may account for the stochasticity of cell fate decisions in stem cells. Here we show that in clonal populations of hematopoietic progenitor cells, spontaneous ``outlier'' cells with either extremely high or low expression levels of the stem cell marker Sca-1 reconstitute the parental distribution of Sca-1 but do so only after more than one week. This slow relaxation is described by a Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) that incorporates noise-driven transitions between discrete subpopulations, suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type. Despite clonality, the Sca-1 outliers had distinct transcriptomes. Although their unique gene expression profiles eventually reversed to that of the median cells, revealing an attractor state, they lasted long enough to confer a greatly different proclivity for choosing either the erythroid or myeloid lineages. Preference in lineage choice was associated with elevated expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, such as a {$>$} 200-fold increase in GATA1 among the erythroid-prone cells, or {$>$} 15-fold increased PU.1 expression among myeloid-prone cell. Thus, clonal heterogeneity of gene expression level is not due to independent noise in the expression of individual genes, but reflects metastable states of a slowly fluctuating transcriptome that is distinct in individual cells and may govern the reversible, stochastic priming of multipotent progenitor cells in cell fate decision.},

New results are discussed, along with applications of probability theory to a wide variety of problems in physics, mathematics, economics, chemistry and biology. It contains many exercises and problems, and is suitable for use as a textbook on graduate level courses involving data analysis. The material is aimed at readers who are already familiar with applied mathematics at an advanced undergraduate level or higher. The book will be of interest to scientists working in any area where inference from incomplete information is necessary. (A cura dell'editore).},

  abstract = {Noise, or random fluctuations, in gene expression may produce variability in cellular behavior. To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  volume = {11},
  issn = {1553-734X},
  abstract = {Successful maintenance of cellular lineages critically depends on the fate decision dynamics of stem cells (SCs) upon division. There are three possible strategies with respect to SC fate decision symmetry: (a) asymmetric mode, when each and every SC division produces one SC and one non-SC progeny; (b) symmetric mode, when 50\% of all divisions produce two SCs and another 50\%\textemdash{}two non-SC progeny; (c) mixed mode, when both the asymmetric and two types of symmetric SC divisions co-exist and are partitioned so that long-term net balance of the lineage output stays constant. Theoretically, either of these strategies can achieve lineage homeostasis. However, it remains unclear which strategy(s) are more advantageous and under what specific circumstances, and what minimal control mechanisms are required to operate them. Here we used stochastic modeling to analyze and quantify the ability of different types of divisions to maintain long-term lineage homeostasis, in the context of different control networks. Using the example of a two-component lineage, consisting of SCs and one type of non-SC progeny, we show that its tight homeostatic control is not necessarily associated with purely asymmetric divisions. Through stochastic analysis and simulations we show that asymmetric divisions can either stabilize or destabilize the lineage system, depending on the underlying control network. We further apply our computational model to biological observations in the context of a two-component lineage of mouse epidermis, where autonomous lineage control has been proposed and notable regional differences, in terms of symmetric division ratio, have been noted\textemdash{}higher in thickened epidermis of the paw skin as compared to ear and tail skin. By using our model we propose a possible explanation for the regional differences in epidermal lineage control strategies. We demonstrate how symmetric divisions can work to stabilize paw epidermis lineage, which experiences high level of micro-injuries and a lack of hair follicles as a back-up source of SCs., Stem cells have long been associated with their ability to divide asymmetrically, when one daughter cell retains stem cell properties of the parent cell, while the other daughter cell becomes more mature and loses its stemness. Recent findings, however, point at the existence of an alternative, symmetric division strategy for stem cells in mammalian tissues. Here we ask the question: what engineering design principles might be responsible for optimization of stem cell division strategies? Although simple intuition may suggest that asymmetric divisions are better suited for stable maintenance of cell population numbers, our analysis shows that asymmetric divisions can also destabilize the system, depending on the particular ``wiring'' of the control loops that govern cellular fate decision making. We apply our theory to one particular unresolved question in mouse epidermis studies\textemdash{}why symmetric division percentage in paw epidermis is twice as high as that in ear and tail? The answer may be related to the fact that paw epidermis lacks hair follicles (a source of stem cells available in other types of skin), and it is also more injury-prone: symmetric divisions help stabilize skin in face of physical stresses from running, digging, grooming, and fighting\textemdash{}things that mice do with their paws. Thus, our theory offers quantitative explanations for the observed designs in stem cell lineages.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of stem cell lineages is of central importance both for healthy and cancerous tissues. We study stochastic population dynamics of stem cells and differentiated cells, where cell decisions, such as proliferation vs. differentiation decisions, or division and death decisions, are under regulation from surrounding cells. The goal is to understand how different types of control mechanisms affect the means and variances of cell numbers. We use the assumption of weak dependencies of the regulatory functions (the controls) on the cell populations near the equilibrium to formulate moment equations. We then study three different methods of closure, showing that they all lead to the same results for the highest order terms in the expressions for the moments. We derive simple explicit expressions for the means and the variances of stem cell and differentiated cell numbers. It turns out that the variance is expressed as an algebraic function of partial derivatives of the controls with respect to the population sizes at the equilibrium. We demonstrate that these findings are consistent with the results previously obtained in the context of particular systems, and also present two novel examples with negative and positive control of division and differentiation decisions. This methodology is formulated without any specific assumptions on the functional form of the controls, and thus can be used for any biological system.},

Rather than single gene traits, all phenotypes involve coordinated activity by multiple interacting cell molecules. Genomes contain abundant and functional repetitive components in addition to the unique coding sequences envisaged in the early days of molecular biology. Combinatorial coding, plus the biochemical abilities cells possess to rearrange DNA molecules, constitute a powerful toolbox for adaptive genome rewriting.

  volume = {6},
  issn = {1662-5145},
  abstract = {Conscious ``free will'' is problematic because (1) brain mechanisms causing consciousness are unknown, (2) measurable brain activity correlating with conscious perception apparently occurs too late for real-time conscious response, consciousness thus being considered ``epiphenomenal illusion,'' and (3) determinism, i.e., our actions and the world around us seem algorithmic and inevitable. The Penrose\textendash{}Hameroff theory of ``orchestrated objective reduction (Orch OR)'' identifies discrete conscious moments with quantum computations in microtubules inside brain neurons, e.g., 40/s in concert with gamma synchrony EEG. Microtubules organize neuronal interiors and regulate synapses. In Orch OR, microtubule quantum computations occur in integration phases in dendrites and cell bodies of integrate-and-fire brain neurons connected and synchronized by gap junctions, allowing entanglement of microtubules among many neurons. Quantum computations in entangled microtubules terminate by Penrose ``objective reduction (OR),'' a proposal for quantum state reduction and conscious moments linked to fundamental spacetime geometry. Each OR reduction selects microtubule states which can trigger axonal firings, and control behavior. The quantum computations are ``orchestrated'' by synaptic inputs and memory (thus ``Orch OR''). If correct, Orch OR can account for conscious causal agency, resolving problem 1. Regarding problem 2, Orch OR can cause temporal non-locality, sending quantum information backward in classical time, enabling conscious control of behavior. Three lines of evidence for brain backward time effects are presented. Regarding problem 3, Penrose OR (and Orch OR) invokes non-computable influences from information embedded in spacetime geometry, potentially avoiding algorithmic determinism. In summary, Orch OR can account for real-time conscious causal agency, avoiding the need for consciousness to be seen as epiphenomenal illusion. Orch OR can rescue conscious free will.},

  title = {The {{Cellular Automaton Interpretation}} of {{Quantum Mechanics}}},
  abstract = {When investigating theories at the tiniest conceivable scales in nature, almost all researchers today revert to the quantum language, accepting the verdict from the Copenhagen doctrine that the only way to describe what is going on will always involve states in Hilbert space, controlled by operator equations. Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical, descriptions will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely contrived theoretical constructions that may or may not reproduce the quantum mechanical phenomena observed in experiments. Dissatisfied, this author investigated how one can look at things differently. This book is an overview of older material, but also contains many new observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked upon as a tool, not as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are classical in essence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue that even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might be viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be classical at its core. We explain how such thoughts can conceivably be reconciled with Bell's theorem, and how the usual objections voiced against the notion of `superdeterminism' can be overcome, at least in principle. Our proposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even the existence of an "arrow of time" can perhaps be explained in a more elegant way than usual. Discussions added in v3: the role of the gravitational force, a mathematical physics definition of free will, and an unconventional view on the arrow of time, amongst others.},

  abstract = {The inherent complexity of biological systems gives rise to complicated mechanistic models with a large number of parameters. On the other hand, the collective behavior of these systems can often be characterized by a relatively small number of phenomenological parameters. We use the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method (MBAM) as a tool for deriving simple phenomenological models from complicated mechanistic models. The resulting models are not black boxes, but remain expressed in terms of the microscopic parameters. In this way, we explicitly connect the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, characterize the equivalence class of distinct systems exhibiting the same range of collective behavior, and identify the combinations of components that function as tunable control knobs for the behavior. We demonstrate the procedure for adaptation behavior exhibited by the EGFR pathway. From a 48 parameter mechanistic model, the system can be effectively described by a single adaptation parameter {$\tau$} characterizing the ratio of time scales for the initial response and recovery time of the system which can in turn be expressed as a combination of microscopic reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and biochemical concentrations. The situation is not unlike modeling in physics in which microscopically complex processes can often be renormalized into simple phenomenological models with only a few effective parameters. The proposed method additionally provides a mechanistic explanation for non-universal features of the behavior.},

  shorttitle = {Ecological Perspectives on Synthetic Biology},
  abstract = {The metabolic capabilities of microbes are the basis for many major biotechnological advances, exploiting microbial diversity by selection or engineering of single strains. However, there are limits to the advances that can be achieved with single strains, and attention has turned toward the metabolic potential of consortia and the field of synthetic ecology. The main challenge for the synthetic ecology is that consortia are frequently unstable, largely because evolution by constituent members affects their interactions, which are the basis of collective metabolic functionality. Current practices in modeling consortia largely consider interactions as fixed circuits of chemical reactions, which greatly increases their tractability. This simplification comes at the cost of essential biological realism, stripping out the ecological context in which the metabolic actions occur and the potential for evolutionary change. In other words, evolutionary stability is not engineered into the system. This realization highlights the necessity to better identify the key components that influence the stable coexistence of microorganisms. Inclusion of ecological and evolutionary principles, in addition to biophysical variables and stoichiometric modeling of metabolism, is critical for microbial consortia design. This review aims to bring ecological and evolutionary concepts to the discussion on the stability of microbial consortia. In particular, we focus on the combined effect of spatial structure (connectivity of molecules and cells within the system) and ecological interactions (reciprocal and non-reciprocal) on the persistence of microbial consortia. We discuss exemplary cases to illustrate these ideas from published studies in evolutionary biology and biotechnology. We conclude by making clear the relevance of incorporating evolutionary and ecological principles to the design of microbial consortia, as a way of achieving evolutionarily stable and sustainable systems.},

  shorttitle = {Bridging the {{Gap}}},
  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of an emerging bottleneck in organism engineering, and paths by which it may be overcome. Recent years have seen the development of a profusion of synthetic biology tools, largely falling into two categories: high-level ``design'' tools aimed at mapping from organism specifications to nucleic acid sequences implementing those specifications, and low-level ``build and test'' tools aimed at faster, cheaper, and more reliable fabrication of those sequences and assays of their behavior in engineered biological organisms. Between the two families, however, there is a major gap: we still largely lack the predictive models and component characterization data required to effectively determine which of the many possible candidate sequences considered in the design phase are the most likely to produce useful results when built and tested. As low-level tools continue to mature, the bottleneck in biological systems engineering is shifting to be dominated by design, making this gap a critical barrier to progress. Considering how to address this gap, we find that widespread adoption of readily available analytic and assay methods is likely to lead to rapid improvement in available predictive models and component characterization models, as evidenced by a number of recent results. Such an enabling development is, in turn, likely to allow high-level tools to break the design barrier and support rapid development of transformative biological applications.},

The biologically relevant concept of information has to do with `meaning', i.e. encoding various biological functions with various degree of evolutionary conservation. Apart from direct experimentation, the meaning, or biological information content, can be extracted and quantified from alignments of homologous nucleotide or amino acid sequences but generally not from a single sequence, using appropriately modified information theoretical formulae. For short, information encoded in genomes is defined vertically but not horizontally. Informally but substantially, biological information density seems to be equivalent to `meaning' of genomic sequences that spans the entire range from sharply defined, universal meaning to effective meaninglessness. Large fractions of genomes, up to 90\% in some plants, belong within the domain of fuzzy meaning. The sequences with fuzzy meaning can be recruited for various functions, with the meaning subsequently fixed, and also could perform generic functional roles that do not require sequence conservation. Biological meaning is continuously transferred between the genomes of selfish elements and hosts in the process of their coevolution. Thus, in order to adequately describe genome function and evolution, the concepts of information theory have to be adapted to incorporate the notion of meaning that is central to biology.},

Indeed ESCs are characterized by unusual chromatin packaging, and a wide variety of chromatin regulators have been implicated in control of pluripotency and differentiation. Genome-wide maps of epigenetic factors have revealed a unique epigenetic signature in pluripotent ESCs and have contributed models to explain their plasticity. In addition to the well known epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications, chromatin remodeling, and non-coding RNA, histone variants are emerging as important regulators of ESC identity. In this review, we summarize and discuss the recent progress that has highlighted the central role of histone variants in ESC pluripotency and ESC fate, focusing, in particular, on H1 variants, H2A variants H2A.X, H2A.Z and macroH2A and H3 variant H3.3.},

  volume = {134},
  issn = {0016-6731},
  abstract = {Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction below classical neutral values resulting from such background selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity, and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive to background selection than the other statistics, unless the population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more. The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles, compared with the classical neutral result. Observed reductions in molecular variation in low recombination genomic regions of sufficiently large size, for instance in the centromere-proximal regions of Drosophila autosomes or in highly selfing plant populations, may be partly due to background selection against deleterious mutations.},

These differences have been attributed to a number of reasons including off-target effects of the antisense reagents. An alternative explanation was recently proposed based on a zebrafish study reporting that genetic compensation was observed in egfl7 mutant but not knockdown animals. Dosage compensation was first reported in Drosophila in 1932, and genetic compensation in response to a gene knockout was first reported in yeast in 1969. Since then, genetic compensation has been documented many times in a number of model organisms; however, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains limited. In this review, we revisit studies reporting genetic compensation in higher eukaryotes and outline possible molecular mechanisms, which may include both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.},

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {Behavioural individuality is thought to be caused by differences in genes and/or environmental conditions. Therefore, if these sources of variation are removed, individuals are predicted to develop similar phenotypes lacking repeatable individual variation. Moreover, even among genetically identical individuals, direct social interactions are predicted to be a powerful factor shaping the development of individuality. We use tightly controlled ontogenetic experiments with clonal fish, the Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), to test whether near-identical rearing conditions and lack of social contact dampen individuality. In sharp contrast to our predictions, we find that (i) substantial individual variation in behaviour emerges among genetically identical individuals isolated directly after birth into highly standardized environments and (ii) increasing levels of social experience during ontogeny do not affect levels of individual behavioural variation.

  abstract = {The eukaryotic cell cycle is robustly designed, with interacting molecules organized within a definite topology that ensures temporal precision of its phase transitions. Its underlying dynamics are regulated by molecular switches, for which remarkable insights have been provided by genetic and molecular biology efforts. In a number of cases, this information has been made predictive, through computational models. These models have allowed for the identification of novel molecular mechanisms, later validated experimentally. Logical modeling represents one of the youngest approaches to address cell cycle regulation. We summarize the advances that this type of modeling has achieved to reproduce and predict cell cycle dynamics. Furthermore, we present the challenge that this type of modeling is now ready to tackle: its integration with intracellular networks, and its formalisms, to understand crosstalks underlying systems level properties, ultimate aim of multi-scale models. Specifically, we discuss and illustrate how such an integration may be realized, by integrating a minimal logical model of the cell cycle with a metabolic network., This article discusses the development of logical modeling of cell cycle regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and perspectives for its integration with cellular networks for multi-scale models.,

  issn = {1553-734X},
  abstract = {The cell division cycle of eukaryotes is governed by a complex network of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) and auxiliary proteins that govern CDK activities. The control system must function reliably in the context of molecular noise that is inevitable in tiny yeast cells, because mistakes in sequencing cell cycle events are detrimental or fatal to the cell or its progeny. To assess the effects of noise on cell cycle progression requires not only extensive, quantitative, experimental measurements of cellular heterogeneity but also comprehensive, accurate, mathematical models of stochastic fluctuations in the CDK control system. In this paper we provide a stochastic model of the budding yeast cell cycle that accurately accounts for the variable phenotypes of wild-type cells and more than 20 mutant yeast strains simulated in different growth conditions. We specifically tested the role of feedback regulations mediated by G1- and SG2M-phase cyclins to minimize the noise in cell cycle progression. Details of the model are informed and tested by quantitative measurements (by fluorescence in situ hybridization) of the joint distributions of mRNA populations in yeast cells. We use the model to predict the phenotypes of \textasciitilde{}30 mutant yeast strains that have not yet been characterized experimentally., The cell division cycle\textemdash{}the process by which a living cell makes a new replica of itself\textemdash{}is fundamental to all aspects of biological growth, development and reproduction. If cells make mistakes in cell cycle progression, they may die or give birth to aberrant progeny. Such mistakes are the root cause of serious human diseases such as cancer. Hence, we would like to understand how cells control cell cycle events and correct mistakes before they do serious damage. Yeast cells are especially suited to studying cell cycle progression because so much is known about the underlying molecular control system, and because yeast cells\textemdash{}being so small\textemdash{}are especially vulnerable to random fluctuations in molecular regulators of the cell cycle. Experimental studies have identified feedback signals in the regulatory network that appear to keep these fluctuations within manageable limits. To place these proposals in a rigorous theoretical framework, we present a stochastic model of the major feedback controls in the yeast cell cycle. Our model accounts accurately for a range of observations about cell cycle variability in wild-type and mutant cells, and makes a host of verifiable predictions about mutant strains that are seriously compromised in cell cycle progression.},

Mutations in human crumbs 1 (CRB1) are a major cause of retinal diseases that lead to blindness. CRB1 is a transmembrane protein found in the inner segment of photoreceptor cells (PRCs) and the apical membrane of M{\"u}ller glia. The function of the extracellular region of CRB1 is poorly understood, although more than 80 disease-causing missense mutations have been mapped to it. We have recreated four of these mutations, affecting different extracellular domains, in Drosophila Crumbs (Crb). Crb regulates epithelial polarity and growth, and contributes to PRC differentiation and survival. The mutant Crb isoforms showed a remarkable diversity in protein abundance, subcellular distribution and ability to rescue the lack of endogenous Crb, elicit a gain-of-function phenotype or promote PRC degeneration. Interestingly, although expression of mutant isoforms led to a substantial rescue of the developmental defects seen in crb mutants, they accelerated PRC degeneration compared to that seen in retinas that lacked Crb, indicating that the function of Crb in cellular differentiation and cell survival depends on distinct molecular pathways. Several Crb mutant proteins accumulated abnormally in the rhabdomere and affected rhodopsin trafficking, suggesting that abnormal rhodopsin physiology contributes to Crb/CRB1-associated retinal degeneration.},

To investigate the cell-cell interactions necessary for the formation of retinal layers, we cultured dissociated zebrafish retinal progenitors in agarose microwells. Within these wells, the cells re-aggregated within hours, forming tight retinal organoids. Using a Spectrum of Fates zebrafish line, in which all different types of retinal neurons show distinct fluorescent spectra, we found that by 48 h in culture, the retinal organoids acquire a distinct spatial organisation, i.e. they became coarsely but clearly laminated. Retinal pigment epithelium cells were in the centre, photoreceptors and bipolar cells were next most central and amacrine cells and retinal ganglion cells were on the outside. Image analysis allowed us to derive quantitative measures of lamination, which we then used to find that M{\"u}ller glia, but not RPE cells, are essential for this process.},

During development, most neurons move from their birthplace to the appropriate layer, where they polarize. However, kinetics and modes of many neuronal translocation events still await exploration. In this study, we investigate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) translocation across the embryonic zebrafish retina. After completing their translocation, RGCs establish the most basal retinal layer where they form the optic nerve. Using in toto light sheet microscopy, we show that somal translocation of RGCs is a fast and directed event. It depends on basal process attachment and stabilized microtubules. Interestingly, interference with somal translocation induces a switch to multipolar migration. This multipolar mode is less efficient but still leads to successful RGC layer formation. When both modes are inhibited though, RGCs fail to translocate and induce lamination defects. This indicates that correct RGC translocation is crucial for subsequent retinal lamination.},

We have used molecular markers to identify progenitors and neurons, short-term bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to map the generation of newborn neurons and dual pulse S-phase labelling to characterise changes in their cell cycle length. Our study revealed the persistence of Sox3-positive progenitor cells from the earliest stages of neural development through to the juvenile adult. Two periods of intense neuronal generation were observed, confirming the existence of primary and secondary waves of neurogenesis, punctuated by a period of quiescence before metamorphosis and culminating in another period of quiescence in the young adult. Analysis of multiple parameters indicates that neural progenitors alternate between global phases of differentiation and amplification and that, regardless of their behaviour, their cell cycle lengthens monotonically during development, at least at the population level., Summary: Our work represents the first continuous analysis of neural progenitor behaviour in X. laevis from early embryogenesis to juvenile stage and identifies two phases of neurogenesis interrupted by a phase of slow increase of the progenitor pool.},

This progress has also enabled the production of photoreceptors from pluripotent stem cells, thereby aiding the development of regenerative medical approaches to eye disease.

 ret has revealed an additional role in kidney
 development. Here we report the analysis of a ret
 homolog in Drosophila melanogaster, an arthropod with no
 neural crest. Drosophila ret (D-ret)
 encodes a protein of 1,235 amino acids that has all of the domains
 identified in the vertebrate ret, including a cadherin
 motif. During embryogenesis, D-ret mRNA is first
 detected in the yolk sac at the late gastrula stage. In the
 postgastrula, D-ret is expressed in the foregut neurons,
 excretory system, peripheral ganglia, and the central nervous system.
 Thus, despite the wide divergence of early embryonic fate maps between
 vertebrates and invertebrates, D-ret is expressed in
 cells that are presumed to be the functional equivalents of the
 ret-expressing cells in vertebrates. Unexpectedly,
 D-ret is also expressed in the imaginal islands of the
 endodermal gut. These cells are proliferation-competent precursors for
 adult midgut that are diffusely embedded in the growth-arrested
 juvenile gut. These ret-expressing nonneuronal cells are
 strikingly analogous to vertebrate enteric neurons in their topography,

Cell fate determination in the developing vertebrate retina is characterized by the sequential generation of seven classes of cells by multipotent progenitor cells. Despite this order of genesis, more than one cell type is generated at any time; for example, in the rat, several cell types are born during the prenatal period, while others are born postnatally. In order to examine whether there are classes of progenitor cells with distinct developmental properties contributing to this developmental progression, we examined antigen expression in progenitor cells during rat retinal development. Two markers of amacrine and horizontal cells, the VC1.1 epitope and syntaxin, were found to be expressed on a subset of progenitors in a temporally regulated manner that closely paralleled the birthdays of these cell types. In order to investigate which cell types were produced by the progenitors expressing these markers, fluorescent latex microspheres covalently coupled to VC1.1 antibodies were used to indelibly label VC1.1+ progenitor cells and their progeny. Early in retinal development, VC1.1+ progenitors generated a high percentage of amacrine and horizontal cells, but no cone photoreceptors. During this same period, a comparable number of cone photoreceptors were generated by VC1.1- progenitors. In the late embryonic and early postnatal period, VC1.1+ progenitors continued to generate predominantly amacrine cells, but also gave rise to an increasing number of rod photoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that expression of these two markers by progenitors is highly correlated with a bias towards the production of amacrine and horizontal cells. The fact that subsets of progenitors with temporally regulated and distinct biases are intermingled within the retinal neuroepithelium provides a basis for understanding how different cell types are generated both simultaneously and in a particular order by multipotent progenitors during retinal development.},

  abstract = {The development of complex tissues requires that mitotic progenitor cells integrate information from the environment. The highly varied outcomes of such integration processes undoubtedly depend at least in part upon variations among the gene expression programs of individual progenitor cells. To date, there has not been a comprehensive examination of these differences among progenitor cells of a particular tissue. Here, we used comprehensive gene expression profiling to define these differences among individual progenitor cells of the vertebrate retina. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) have been shown by lineage analysis to be multipotent throughout development and to produce distinct types of daughter cells in a temporal, conserved order. A total of 42 single RPCs were profiled on Affymetrix arrays. In situ hybridizations performed on both retinal sections and dissociated retinal cells were used to validate the results of the microarrays. An extensive amount of heterogeneity in gene expression among RPCs, even among cells isolated from the same developmental time point, was observed. While many classes of genes displayed heterogeneity of gene expression, the expression of transcription factors constituted a significant amount of the observed heterogeneity. In contrast to previous findings, individual RPCs were found to express multiple bHLH transcription factors, suggesting alternative models to those previously developed concerning how these factors may be coordinated. Additionally, the expression of cell cycle related transcripts showed differences among those associated with G2 and M, versus G1 and S phase, suggesting different levels of regulation for these genes. These data provide insights into the types of processes and genes that are fundamental to cell fate choices, proliferation decisions, and, for cells of the central nervous system, the underpinnings of the formation of complex circuitry.},

We identified a 450 bp Pax6 enhancer that contains two interacting sequences: a 274 bp fragment sufficient for expression in retinal progenitors and an adjacent 156 bp fragment required for expression in pancreatic progenitors. Since this enhancer is only transiently expressed during embryogenesis, a Cre-loxP fate-mapping strategy was used to investigate the developmental potential of these progenitors. Surprisingly, the labeled retinal precursors predominantly gave rise to horizontal cells, indicating a cell lineage role in horizontal cell differentiation. In the pancreas, all enhancer-specific cells were restricted to endocrine and ductal cell lineages. This result lends support to a model whereby Pax6-expressing progenitors contribute to the adult pancreatic islets and ducts. The progenitor cell-specificity of this enhancer will be useful in studies that require either cell-specific expression or conditional gene inactivation in these cell populations. genesis 35:22\textendash{}30, 2003. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Fluorescent dextran was iontophoretically injected into single cells of the embryonic optic vesicle. After further development of the embryo, labeled descendants were observed in all three layers of the larval retina. Furthermore, different clones were composed of various combinations of all major cell types, including the glial Muller cells. Hence, single optic vesicle cells have the potential to form any type of retinal cell, suggesting that the interactions that specify the differentiation pathway of retinal cells must occur late in development.},

  abstract = {The Immortal Strand Hypothesis proposes that asymmetrically dividing stem cells cosegregate chromatids to retain ancestral DNA templates. Using both pulse-chase and label retention assays, we show that non-random partitioning of DNA occurs in germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila ovary as these divide asymmetrically to generate a new GSC and a differentiating cystoblast. This process is disrupted when GSCs are forced to differentiate through the overexpression of Bag of Marbles, a factor that impels the terminal differentiation of cystoblasts. When Decapentaplegic, a ligand which maintains the undifferentiated state of GSCs, is expressed ectopically the non-random partitioning of DNA is similarly disrupted. Our data suggest asymmetric chromatid segregation is coupled to mechanisms specifying cellular differentiation via asymmetric stem cell division.},

Replication-incompetent retroviral vectors encoding either human placental alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, or a viral core protein were used in paired combinations to infect retinal progenitor cells from Embryonic Days 2.5-7.0. Labeled clones were analyzed late in embryonic development after retinal histogenesis was complete. The early accessibility of the chicken retina, combined with its large final size, resulted in the labeling of much larger clones than had been reported previously in other species. The clones were composed of many cell types, supporting previous conclusions from other vertebrates that the progenitor cells of developing retina are multipotent. The majority of clones derived from early infections consisted of multiple tightly clustered arrays of cells accompanied by dispersed individual cells. Clonal complexity and tangential dispersion were greater in peripheral than central retina and decreased considerably with increasing age of infection. These observations suggest that early during retinal development, shortly after optic cup formation, there is considerable mixing of progenitor cells.},

Here we describe the use of exo utero surgery to introduce a marker retrovirus into the proliferative zone of the retinas of embryonic day 13 and 14 mice. Analysis of marked clones in the resulting adult retinas shows that almost all progenitor cells that continued mitosis were multipotential and that a single progenitor can generate most retinal cell types. The size of marked clones indicates that retinal cells do not employ a stem cell mode of division, but instead, both daughter cells of a progenitor can continue to divide. These results suggest that cell type determination in the rodent retina is independent of lineage. We propose a model for the generation of retinal cell types in which the cessation of mitosis and cell type determination are independent events, controlled by environmental interactions.},

In the mammalian retina, different cell types develop on a predictable schedule from multipotent retinal neuroepithelial cells (RNECs). A current view is that RNECs pass through a series of competence states, progressively changing their responsiveness to instructive extracellular cues, which also change over time. We show here, however, that embryonic day 16-17 (E16-17) rat RNECs develop similarly in serum-free clonal-density cultures and in serum-containing retinal explants--in the number of times they divide, the cell types they generate, and the order in which they generate these cell types. These surprising results suggest that extracellular signals may be less important than currently believed in determining when RNECs stop dividing and what cell types they generate when they withdraw from the cell cycle, at least from E16-17 onward.},

  volume = {138},
  issn = {0950-1991},
  abstract = {In vivo cell lineage-tracing studies in the vertebrate retina have revealed that the sizes and cellular compositions of retinal clones are highly variable. It has been challenging to ascertain whether this variability reflects distinct but reproducible lineages among many different retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) or is the product of stochastic fate decisions operating within a population of more equivalent RPCs. To begin to distinguish these possibilities, we developed a method for long-term videomicroscopy to follow the lineages of rat perinatal RPCs cultured at clonal density. In such cultures, cell-cell interactions between two different clones are eliminated and the extracellular environment is kept constant, allowing us to study the cell-intrinsic potential of a given RPC. Quantitative analysis of the reconstructed lineages showed that the mode of division of RPCs is strikingly consistent with a simple stochastic pattern of behavior in which the decision to multiply or differentiate is set by fixed probabilities. The variability seen in the composition and order of cell type genesis within clones is well described by assuming that each of the four different retinal cell types generated at this stage is chosen stochastically by differentiating neurons, with relative probabilities of each type set by their abundance in the mature retina. Although a few of the many possible combinations of cell types within clones occur at frequencies that are incompatible with a fully stochastic model, our results support the notion that stochasticity has a major role during retinal development and therefore possibly in other parts of the central nervous system.},

Gal4-VP16 then activates expression of a fluorescent protein from an upstream activating sequence (UAS) promoter. Marked clones of cells expressing any desired gene product can be generated by crossing MAZe fish with other lines containing UAS-driven transgenes. The number of clones induced, and their time of origin, could be varied by adjusting heat-shock timing and duration. As an alternative to heat shock, we introduced Cre under a tissue-specific promoter in MAZe fish to generate clones in a designated tissue.},

  title = {Spherical Coordinate System},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the radial distance of that point from a fixed origin, its polar angle measured from a fixed zenith direction, and the azimuth angle of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane that passes through the origin and is orthogonal to the zenith, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane. It can be seen as the three-dimensional version of the polar coordinate system.
The radial distance is also called the radius or radial coordinate. The polar angle may be called colatitude, zenith angle, normal angle, or inclination angle.
The use of symbols and the order of the coordinates differs between sources. In one system frequently encountered in physics (r, \texttheta, {$\varphi$}) gives the radial distance, polar angle, and azimuthal angle, whereas in another system used in many mathematics books (r, \texttheta, {$\varphi$}) gives the radial distance, azimuthal angle, and polar angle. In both systems {$\rho$} is often used instead of r. Other conventions are also used, so great care needs to be taken to check which one is being used.
A number of different spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a number of different celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the x-axis to the y-axis rather than clockwise from north (0\textdegree{}) to east (+90\textdegree{}) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.
The spherical coordinate system generalises the two-dimensional polar coordinate system. It can also be extended to higher-dimensional spaces and is then referred to as a hyperspherical coordinate system.},

Methods: For this we have been using laurdan, C-laurdan or M-laurdan to label a variety of cells, and a biphoton microscope equipped with both a thermostatic chamber and a spectral analyser. We also used a flow cytometer to quantify the 450/530 nm ratio of fluorescence emissions by whole cells., 
Results: We find that using all the information provided by spectral analysis to perform spectral decomposition dramatically improves the imaging resolution compared to using just two channels, as commonly used to calculate generalized polarisation (GP). Coupled to a new plugin called Fraction Mapper, developed to represent the fraction of light intensity in the first component in a stack of two images, we obtain very clear pictures of both the intra-cellular distribution of the probes, and the polarity of the cellular environments where the lipid probes are localised.,  Our results lead us to conclude that, in live cells kept at 37\textdegree{}C, laurdan, and M-laurdan to a lesser extent, have a strong tendency to accumulate in the very apolar environment of intra-cytoplasmic lipid droplets, but label the plasma membrane (PM) of mammalian cells ineffectively. On the other hand, C-laurdan labels the PM very quickly and effectively, and does not detectably accumulate in lipid droplets., 
Conclusions: From using these probes on a variety of mammalian cell lines, as well as on cells from
Drosophila and
Dictyostelium discoideum, we conclude that, apart from the lipid droplets, which are very apolar, probes in intracellular membranes reveal a relatively polar and hydrated environment, suggesting a very marked dominance of liquid disordered states. PMs, on the other hand, are much more apolar, suggesting a strong dominance of liquid ordered state, which fits with their high sterol contents.},

  abstract = {While retinal degeneration and disease results in permanent damage and vision loss in humans, the severely damaged zebrafish retina has a high capacity to regenerate lost neurons and restore visual behaviors. Advancements in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this regeneration response give hope that strategies and therapeutics may be developed to restore sight to blind and visually-impaired individuals. Our current understanding has been facilitated by the amenability of zebrafish to molecular tools, imaging techniques, and forward and reverse genetic approaches. Accordingly, the zebrafish research community has developed a diverse array of research tools for use in developing and adult animals, including toolkits for facilitating the generation of transgenic animals, systems for inducible, cell-specific transgene expression, and the creation of knockout alleles for nearly every protein coding gene. As CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has begun to revolutionize molecular biology research, the zebrafish community has responded in stride by developing CRISPR/Cas9 techniques for the zebrafish as well as incorporating CRISPR/Cas9 into available toolsets. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 to retinal regeneration research will undoubtedly bring us closer to understanding the mechanisms underlying retinal repair and vision restoration in the zebrafish, as well as developing therapeutic approaches that will restore vision to blind and visually-impaired individuals. This review focuses on how CRISPR/Cas9 has been integrated into zebrafish research toolsets and how this new tool will revolutionize the field of retinal regeneration research.},

  abstract = {I begin by tracing some of the confusions regarding levels and ``reduction'' to a failure to distinguish two different principles according to which theories can be viewed as hierarchically arranged \textemdash{} epistemic authority and ontological constitution. I then argue that the notion of levels relevant to the debate between symbolic and connectionist paradigms of mental activity answers to neither of these models, but is rather correlative to the hierarchy of functional decompositions of cognitive tasks characteristic of ``homuncular functionalism''. Finally, I suggest that the incommensurability of the intentional and extensional vocabularies constitutes a strongprima facie reason to conclude that there is little likelihood of filling in the story of Bechtel's ``missing level'' in such a way as to bridge the gap between such ``homuncular functionalism'' and his own model of mechanistic explanation.},

The basic concepts, methods and structure of the field are set out, as well as key limitations and challenges. The second part of the book shows how rigorous explanations emerge from stem cell experiments, and compares these to other kinds of scientific explanation. Model organisms, the role of genes, and the significance of collaboration are also discussed. The last part of the book considers relations to systems biology and clinical medicine, arguing that both the mathematical models of the former, and ethical principles of the latter, are necessary for stem cell biology to deliver on its promises --},

  abstract = {Cell cycle regulation is crucial for the maintenance of stem cell populations in adult mammalian tissues. During development, the cell cycle length in neural stem cells increases, which could be associated with their capabilities for self-renewal. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate differentiation and cell cycle progression in embryonic neural stem cells remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the function of Bre1a, a histone H2B ubiquitylation factor, which is expressed in most but not all of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the developing mouse brain. We found that the knockdown of Bre1a in NPCs lengthened their cell cycle through the upregulation of p57kip2 and the downregulation of Cdk2. In addition, the knockdown of Bre1a increased the expression of Hes5, an effector gene of Notch signaling, through the action of Fezf1 and Fezf2 genes and suppressed the differentiation of NPCs. Our data suggest that Bre1a could be a bifunctional gene that regulates both the differentiation status and cell cycle length of NPCs. We propose a novel model that the Bre1a-negative cells in the ventricular zone of early embryonic brains remain undifferentiated and are selected as self-renewing neural stem cells, which increase their cell cycle time during development.},

  abstract = {Coloboma is a defect in the morphogenesis of the eye that is a consequence of failure of choroid fissure fusion. It is among the most common congenital defects in humans and can significantly impact vision. However, very little is known about the cellular mechanisms that regulate choroid fissure closure. Using high-resolution confocal imaging of the zebrafish optic cup, we find that apico-basal polarity is re-modeled in cells lining the fissure in proximal to distal and inner to outer gradients during fusion. This process is accompanied by cell proliferation, displacement of vasculature, and contact between cells lining the choroid fissure and periocular mesenchyme (POM). To investigate the role of POM cells in closure of the fissure, we transplanted optic vesicles onto the yolk, allowing them to develop in a situation where they are depleted of POM. The choroid fissure forms normally in ectopic eyes but fusion fails in this condition, despite timely apposition of the nasal and temporal lips of the retina. This study resolves some of the cell behaviors underlying choroid fissure fusion and supports a role for POM in choroid fissure fusion.},

All vertebrate retinas share a fundamental plan, comprising five major neuronal cell classes with cell body distributions and connectivity arranged in stereotypic patterns. Conserved features in retinal design have enabled detailed analysis and comparisons of structure, connectivity and function across species. Each species, however, can adopt structural and/or functional retinal specializations, implementing variations to the basic design in order to satisfy unique requirements in visual function. Recent advances in molecular tools, imaging and electrophysiological approaches have greatly facilitated identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that establish the fundamental organization of the retina and the specializations of its microcircuits during development. Here, we review advances in our understanding of how these mechanisms act to shape structure and function at the single cell level, to coordinate the assembly of cell populations, and to define their specific circuitry. We also highlight how structure is rearranged and function is disrupted in disease, and discuss current approaches to re-establish the intricate functional architecture of the retina.},

Any change in the normal brain environment results in microglial activation, which can be detrimental if not appropriately regulated. Aberrant microglial function has been linked to the development of several neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, microglia also possess potent immunoregulatory and regenerative capacities, making them attractive targets for therapeutic manipulation. Such rationale manipulations will, however, require in-depth knowledge of their origins and the molecular mechanisms underlying their homeostasis. Here, we discuss the latest advances in our understanding of the origin, differentiation, and homeostasis of microglial cells and their myelomonocytic relatives in the CNS.},

  title = {An Introduction to {{Galton}}-{{Watson}} Trees and Their Local Limits},
  abstract = {The main object of this course given in Hammamet (December 2014) is the so-called Galton-Watson process. We introduce in the first chapter of this course the framework of discrete random trees. We then use this framework to construct GW trees that describe the genealogy of a GW process. It is very easy to recover the GW process from the GW tree as it is just the number of individuals at each generation. We then give alternative proofs of classical results on GW processes using the tree formalism. We focus in particular on the extinction probability (which was the first question of F. Galton) and on the description of the processes conditioned on extinction or non extinction. In a second chapter, we focus on local limits of conditioned GW trees. In the critical and sub-critical cases, the population becomes a.s. extinct and the associated genealogical tree is finite. However, it has a small but positive probability of being large (this notion must be precised). The question that arises is to describe the law of the tree conditioned of being large, and to say what exceptional event has occurred so that the tree is not typical. A first answer to this question is due to H. Kesten who conditioned a GW tree to reach height n and look at the limit in distribution when n tends to infinity. There are however other ways of conditioning a tree to be large: conditioning on having many vertices, or many leaves... We present here very recent general results concerning this kind of problems due to the authors of this course and completed by results of X. He.},

  abstract = {Stem cell biology and systems biology are two prominent new approaches to studying cell development. In stem cell biology, the predominant method is experimental manipulation of concrete cells and tissues. Systems biology, in contrast, emphasizes mathematical modeling of cellular systems. For scientists and philosophers interested in development, an important question arises: how should the two approaches relate? This essay proposes an answer, using the model of Waddington's landscape to triangulate between stem cell and systems approaches. This simple abstract model represents development as an undulating surface of hills and valleys. Originally constructed by C. H. Waddington to visually explicate an integrated theory of genetics, development and evolution, the landscape model can play an updated unificatory role. I examine this model's structure, representational assumptions, and uses in all three contexts, and argue that explanations of cell development require both mathematical models and concrete experiments. On this view, the two approaches are interdependent, with mathematical models playing a crucial but circumscribed role in explanations of cell development.},

Technological advances that allow deeper penetration in live tissues, such as the development of confocal and two-photon microscopy, together with the generation of ever-new fluorophores that facilitate bright labelling of cells and tissue components have made imaging of vertebrate model organisms efficient and highly informative. Genetic manipulation leading to expression of fluorescent proteins is undoubtedly the labelling method of choice and has been used to visualize several cell types in vivo. This approach, however, can be technically challenging and time consuming. Over the years, several dyes have been developed to allow rapid, effective and bright ex vivo labelling of cells for subsequent transplantation and imaging. Here, we review and discuss the advantages and limitations of a number of strategies commonly used to label and track cells at high resolution in vivo in mouse and zebrafish, using fluorescence microscopy. While the quest for the perfect label is far from achieved, current reagents are valuable tools enabling the progress of biological discovery, so long as they are selected and used appropriately.},

  volume = {50},
  issn = {10447431},
  abstract = {The vertebrate neural retina contains seven major cell types, which arise from a common multipotent progenitor pool. During neurogenesis, these cells stop cycling, commit to a single fate, and differentiate. The mechanism and order of these steps remain unclear. The first-born type of retinal neurons, ganglion cells (RGCs), develop through the actions of Math5 (Atoh7), Brn3b (Pou4f2) and Islet1 (Isl1) factors, whereas inhibitory amacrine and horizontal precursors require Ptf1a for differentiation. We have examined the link between these markers, and the timing of their expression during the terminal cell cycle, by nucleoside pulsechase analysis in the mouse retina. We show that G2 phase lasts 1\textendash{}2 h at embryonic (E) 13.5 and E15.5 stages. Surprisingly, we found that cells expressing Brn3b and/or Isl1 were frequently co-labeled with EdU after a short chase (b 1 h) in early embryos (b E14), indicating that these factors, which mark committed RGCs, can be expressed during S or G2 phases. However, during late development ({$>$} E15), Brn3b and Isl1 were exclusively expressed in post-mitotic cells, even as new RGCs are still generated. In contrast, Ptf1a and amacrine marker AP2{$\alpha$} were detected only after terminal mitosis, at all developmental stages. Using a retroviral tracer in embryonic retinal explants (E12\textendash{}E13), we identified two-cell clones containing paired ganglion cells, consistent with RGC fate commitment prior to terminal mitosis. Thus, although cell cycle exit and fate determination are temporally correlated during retinal neurogenesis, the order of these events varies according to developmental stage and final cell type.},

Recently, Batten et al. (2008) in a paper in this journal, entitled ``Visions of evolution: self-organization proposes what natural selection disposes,'' picked up the issue with the work of Depew and Weber as a starting point. While the efforts of both sets of authors are to be commended, there are substantive errors in both the presentations of my work and of my work with colleagues (one of the ``visions'' discussed) that undermine theirs. My purpose here is to correct the errors in question, thereby removing the undermining effects and in so doing reassert the position my colleagues and I first advanced more than two decades ago, and that I still stand by and argue for today. The central points are as follows: (1) Self-organization or spontaneous ordering is a process of selection; (2) this selection process is governed by a ``physical selection principle''; (3) this principle is the law of maximum entropy production; and (4) natural selection is a special case where the components are replicating.},

  volume = {5},
  issn = {2328-4277},
  abstract = {Abstract It is a matter of public consensus that China's high growth rate has been achieved at the expense of natural resources and the environment, leading to serious risks to sustainability. This research, which proposes a theoretical model to forewarn of risks to regional developmental sustainability in China, constitutes the first empirical evaluation of this to be undertaken there. The results show that: (a) the areas at risk cover almost 43\% of the land and 44\% of the population of mainland China. In those areas, 83.56\% of people at risk are threatened by the low carrying capacity of the environment and limited water resources. (b) With 70\% of the total population living in ?at risk? areas, urbanization zones remain as the primary category suffering from overload across China. Extensive industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution, which contributes the most to the forewarning status, while the secondary cause is found to be the special coupling of the scarcity of natural water resources and their inefficient use. In addition, most urban conglomerations suffer from pollution by industrial production and household consumption, which tends to extend to their surrounding agricultural areas. Extensive mineral exploitation in ecologically fragile areas has made them increasingly more vulnerable to disturbances from their neighboring resource?driven urban areas. The paper uses these findings to suggest how to intensify the special regulatory administration of resources and the environment, and to transform approaches to industrialization, in order to address sustainable development issues in developing countries.},

The evolutionary origin of the inner germ layers, endoderm and mesoderm, and their relationship have been a matter of debate for decades. In this review we summarize the major modes of endoderm and mesoderm formation found in Metazoa and possible evolutionary scenarios to reconstruct the ancestral state. In the second part, we address the question whether endoderm as well as mesoderm are homologous among Bilateria. In this regard, we propose that the comparative analysis of some crucial transcription factors involved in the early specification and differentiation of these germ layers might provide cues for the level of homology. We focus on four classes of genes: the Zn-finger gene GATA 4-6, the bHLH gene twist, the Kr{\"u}ppel-like Zn-finger gene snail and the T-box gene brachyury. The role of each of these genes in mesendoderm formation is summarized and we propose that the specific function of each of these genes in endoderm and mesoderm formation evolved from the regulation of basic cellular features, such as cell adhesion, cell motility, cytoskeleton and cell cycle.},

Different techniques have been developed and applied to uncover the intrinsic mechanism of genome architecture, especially the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and 3C-derived methods. 3C and 3C-derived techniques provide us approaches to perform high-throughput chromatin architecture assays at the genome scale. However, the advantage and disadvantage of current methodologies of C-technologies have not been discussed extensively. In this review, we described and compared the methodologies of C-technologies used in genome organization studies with an emphasis on Hi-C method. We also discussed the crucial challenges facing current genome architecture studies based on 3C and 3C-derived technologies and the direction of future technologies to address currently outstanding questions in the field. These latest news contribute to our current understanding of genome structure, and provide a comprehensive reference for researchers to choose the appropriate method in future application. We consider that these constantly improving technologies will offer a finer and more accurate contact profiles of entire genome and ultimately reveal specific molecular machines govern its shape and function.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome is intimately related to numerous key biological functions including gene expression and DNA replication regulations. The mechanisms by which molecular drivers functionally organize the 3D genome, such as topologically associating domains (TADs), remain to be explored. Current approaches consist in assessing the enrichments or influences of proteins at TAD borders. Here, we propose a TADfree model to directly estimate the blocking effects of architectural proteins, insulators and DNA motifs on long-range contacts, making the model intuitive and biologically meaningful. In addition, the model allows analyzing the whole Hi-C information content (2D information) instead of only focusing on TAD borders (1D information). The model outperforms multiple logistic regression at TAD borders in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and is validated by enhancer-blocking assays. In Drosophila, the results support the insulating role of simple sequence repeats and suggest that the blocking effects depend on the number of repeats. Motif analysis uncovered the roles of the transcriptional factors pannier and tramtrack in blocking long-range contacts. In human, the results suggest that the blocking effects of the well-known architectural proteins CTCF, cohesin and ZNF143 depend on the distance between loci, where each protein may participate at different scales of the 3D chromatin organization.},

In reality, any biochemical machine for which a DNA codescript is efficacious is itself produced through the mechanical interpretation of an identical or very similar codescript. In these terms the origin of life can be described as a bootstrap process involving the simultaneous accumulation of genetic information and the generation of a machine that interprets it as instructions for its own construction. This problem is discussed within the theoretical frameworks of thermodynamics, informatics and self-reproducing automata, paying special attention to the physico-chemical origin of genetic coding and the conditions, both thermodynamic and informatic, that a system must fulfil in order for it to sustain semiosis. The origin of life is equated with biosemiosis.},

  volume = {119},

  shorttitle = {Naturalizing Semiotics},
  abstract = {The father of pragmatism, Charles Sanders Peirce, gave in 1903 the following definition of a sign: ``A Sign, or Representamen, is a First which stands in such a genuine triadic relation to a Second, called its Object, as to be capable of determining a Third, called its Interpretant, to assume the same triadic relation to its Object in which it stands itself to the same Object. The triadic relation is genuine, that is its three members are bound together by it in a way that does not consist in any complexus of dyadic relations''. Despite its cult status and its pragmatic foundation, the Peircean sign has never revealed its true potential by being integrated into a formal system. In the present report, a reconstruction of the sign model is presented, which may at first appear somewhat obvious and superficial. However by use of the reconstructed model, the above statement and the majority of Peirce's other statements about the nature of signs fall into place. Instead of defining three links between Object (O), Representamen (R), and Interpretant (I), the sign is described as having a single three-dimensional link, specifying its location in a three dimensional (O,R,I) linkage space. To understand and explain sign function, the process of sign utilization (semiosis) has to be divided into two temporally separated phases, a sign-establishment phase where a three-dimensional link (J(O,R,I)) is formed between three sign elements, and a later sign-interpretation phase where the established linkage is used for inferring significance to a novel phenomenon, if this satisfies the criteria for being a Representamen for the sign. Numerous statements from Peirce indicate that he used a twostaged semiosis paradigm although he did not state that explicitly.},

  issn = {1875-1342, 1875-1350},
  abstract = {In contrast to the traditional relational semiotics, biosemiotics decisively deviates towards dynamical aspects of signs at the evolutionary and developmental time scales. The analysis of sign dynamics requires constructivism (in a broad sense) to explain how new components such as subagents, sensors, effectors, and interpretation networks are produced by developing and evolving organisms. Semiotic networks that include signs, tools, and subagents are multilevel, and this feature supports the plasticity, robustness, and evolvability of organisms. The origin of life is described here as the emergence of simple self-constructing semiotic networks that progressively increased the diversity of their components and relations. Primitive organisms have no capacity to classify and track objects; thus, we need to admit the existence of proto-signs that directly regulate activities of agents without being associated with objects. However, object recognition and handling became possible in eukaryotic species with the development of extensive rewritable epigenetic memory as well as sensorial and effector capacities. Semiotic networks are based on sequential and recursive construction, where each step produces components (i.e., agents, scaffolds, signs, and resources) that are needed for the following steps of construction. Construction is not limited to repair and reproduction of what already exists or is unambiguously encoded, it also includes production of new components and behaviors via learning and evolution. A special case is the emergence of new levels of organization known as metasystem transition. Multilevel semiotic networks reshape the phenotype of organisms by combining a mosaic of features developed via learning and evolution of cooperating and/or conflicting subagents.},

  issn = {1875-1342, 1875-1350},
  abstract = {Contemporary textbooks often define evolution in terms of the replication, mutation, and selective retention of DNA sequences, ignoring the contribution of the physical processes involved. In the closing line of The Origin of Species, however, Darwin recognized that natural selection depends on prior more basic living functions, which he merely described as life's Bseveral powers.\^ For Darwin these involved the organism's capacity to maintain itself and to reproduce offspring that preserve its critical functional organization. In modern terms we have come to recognize that this involves the continual generation of complex organic molecules in complex configurations accomplished with the aid of persistent far-from-equilibrium chemical selforganizing and self-assembling processes. But reliable persistence and replication of these processes also requires constantly available constraints and boundary conditions. Organism autonomy further requires that these constraints and co-dependent dynamics are reciprocally produced, each by the other. In this paper I argue that the different constraint-amplifying dynamics of two or more self-organizing processes can be coupled so that they reciprocally generate each other's critical supportive boundary conditions. This coupling is a higher-order constraint (which can be distributed among components or offloaded onto molecular structures) that effectively constitutes a sign vehicle Binterpreted\^ by the synergistic dynamics of these co-dependent self-organizing process so that they reconstitute this same semiotic-dynamic relationship and its self-reconstituting potential in new substrates. This dynamical co-dependence constitutes Darwin's Bseveral powers\^ and is the basis of the biosemiosis that enables evolution.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1875-1342, 1875-1350},
  abstract = {Post-translational histone modifications and their biological effects have been described as a `histone code'. Independently, Barbieri used the term `organic code' to describe biological codes in addition to the genetic code. He also provided the defining criteria for an organic code, but to date the histone code has not been tested against these criteria. This paper therefore investigates whether the histone code is a bona fide organic code. After introducing the use of the term `code' in biology, the criteria a putative organic code such as the histone code must conform to in order to be recognised as an organic code are described. Our current knowledge of histones and their major post-translational modifications, and the specific protein binding domains that recognise and translate these into specific biological effects, is then reviewed in detail. The histone modification system is then placed in the context of an organic code and it is concluded that it fulfils all the requirements of an organic code. The marks produced on histones by processes such as acetylation and methylation act as organic signs that are translated into unique biological effects, their biological meanings. These translations are accomplished by effector proteins that consist of a binding domain that recognises a specific histone mark and a regulatory domain that mediates the biological effect. Crucially, these domains can be experimentally interchanged between different effector proteins, thus altering the rules that specify the relationships between sign and meaning. The effector proteins therefore fulfil the role of adaptor molecules.},

  issn = {1875-1342, 1875-1350},
  abstract = {The threshold from unicellularity to multicellularity has been crossed only in three major living domains in evolution with any lasting success. The hard problem was to create a multicellular self. Such a self is vulnerable to breakdown due to the unavoidable appearance of mutant anarchistic cells, and stringent semiotic scaffoldings had to emerge to prevent this. While a unicellular self may go on to live practically forever, the multicellular self most often must run through an individuation process ending in the death of the individual. Due to basic differences in cells of plants, fungi and animals this individuation process poses very different challenges in the three kingdoms of plants, fungi and animals, and the solutions found to these differences are discussed. In the same time as multicellularity ushered life into the epoch of mortality it logically also led to the appearance of fertilization and thereby the need for a whole new set of elaborate semiotic scaffoldings. Multicellularity also opened the door to the formation symbiotic relations where cells with different genomes might collaborate or at least coexist inside the same body. All in all multicellularity led to an enormous diversification both of morphology space and the space of sensomotoric elaborations. New means for scaffolding of this expansion and diversification of possible life forms into functional patterns called for a corresponding growth in the space of semiotic tools (chemical processes, heat, light, sound, volatile chemicals, magnetism, radiation of many sorts, etc.) and initiated a growth in semiotic freedom, that has continued to our days.},

As the conscious use of signs is well-covered by the various fields of semiotics, we focus on subconscious sign action. Subconscious semiotic habits, both functional and dysfunctional, may be created and reinforced in the brain not necessarily in a logical manner and not necessarily through repeated reinforcement. We review literature that suggests hypnosis may be effective in changing subconscious dysfunctional habits, and we offer a biosemiotic framework for understanding these results. If it has been difficult to evaluate any psychological approach, including hypnosis, this may be because contemporary neuroscience lacks a theory of the sign. We argue that understanding the fluid nature of representation in biological organisms is prerequisite to understanding the nature of the subconscious and may lead to more effective of treatments for dysfunctional habits developed through personal experience or culture.},

  abstract = {The concept of scaffolding has wide resonance in several scientific fields. Here we attempt to adopt it for the study of development. In this perspective, the embryo is conceived as an integral whole, comprised of several hierarchical modules as in a recurrent circularity of emerging patterns. Within the developmental hierarchy, each module yields an inter-level relationship that makes it possible for the scaffolding to mediate the production of selectable variations. A wide range of genetic, cellular and morphological mechanisms allows the scaffolding to integrate these modular variations into a functionally coordinate unit. A genetic scaffolding accounts for the inherited invariance of pattern formation during the embryo's growth. At higher level, cells behave as agents endowed with the capacity to interpret any scaffolding variation as signs. The full hierarchy of a multi-level scaffolding is eventually attained when the embryo acquires the capacity to impose a number of developmental constraints on its constituting parts in a top-down direction. The acquisition of this capacity allows a semiotic threshold to emerge between the living cellular world and the underlying nonliving molecular world. As this boundary is gradually defined during development, cells enter into new functional relationships, while, at the same time, are relieved from their physical determinism. The resulting constraints can thus become the driving forces that upgrade embryonic scaffolding from the simple molecular signalling to the complexity of sign recognition proper of a cellular community. In this semiotic perspective, the apparent goal directness of any developmental strategy should no longer be accounted for by a predetermined genetic program, but by the gradual definition of the relationships selected amongst the ones historically explored.},

We review here the concept of `semiotic threshold', first describing its denotation within semiotics via an examination on the history of the concept, its synonyms, antonyms, etymology, usage in other languages and context in which it is used. Then we present a general overview of the survey among researchers, analyzing the difference in responses for the concept of `lower semiotic threshold' and related concepts. From the answers we also review the difference between the general usage of `semiotic threshold' versus its specific use within biosemiotics, and attempt to make a general synthesis of the concept taking into account what we have learned from the survey and the literature review.},

  abstract = {A widely remarked fact about On the Origin of Species is that it is not about "origins" per se\textemdash{}singular points at which something new begins\textemdash{}but about gradual changes in the proportions of already existing forms. Artists and others have long resisted Darwin's revolution on the grounds that natural selection does not explain evolution, a theory of which must include a theory of actual creativity. In early 20th-century biology, there were still many vocal and powerful dissenters: William Bateson and C. H. Waddington (also a painter and a poet), Richard Goldschmidt, and D'Arcy Thompson, who were heir to 19th-century teleomechanists and morphologists such as von Baer, Mivart, Owen, Muller, and Geoffroy. Repressed in the 1950s during the hardening of the Modern Synthesis, ideas about evolutionary creativity and progress have bubbled up again. Saltationists have increased in number, and Robert G. B. Reid, in his recent Biological Emergences: Evolution by Natural Experiment (2007), describes a neoDarwinian house that is now deeply altered from within. Many of those calling themselves selectionists have actually strayed far from the fold insofar as their research shows that saltatory changes occur and the resulting organisms are immediately viable, making natural selection as a force of change superfluous. Now is precisely not the time for students of literature to start looking to Darwinists for guidance. Rather the reverse is true: neoDarwinists could do well to refocus attention on creativity and the processes whereby variations come to be. This paper examines non-Darwinian authorship in Vladmir Nabokov, Henry James and various other 20th century novelists.},

  abstract = {Cell lineage commitment and differentiation are governed by a complex gene regulatory network. Disruption of these processes by inappropriate regulatory signals and by mutational rewiring of the network can lead to tumorigenesis. Cancer cells often exhibit immature or embryonic traits and dysregulated developmental genes can act as oncogenes. However, the prevailing paradigm of somatic evolution and multi-step tumorigenesis, while useful in many instances, offers no logically coherent reason for why oncogenesis recapitulates ontogenesis. The formal concept of ``cancer attractors'', derived from an integrative, complex systems approach to gene regulatory network may provide a natural explanation. Here we present the theory of attractors in gene network dynamics and review the concept of cell types as attractors. We argue that cancer cells are trapped in abnormal attractors and discuss this concept in the light of recent ideas in cancer biology, including cancer genomics and cancer stem cells, as well as the implications for differentiation therapy.},

  volume = {10},
  issn = {1742-4682},
  abstract = {Background: Normal colon crypts consist of stem cells, proliferating cells, and differentiated cells. Abnormal rates of proliferation and differentiation can initiate colon cancer. We have measured the variation in the number of each of these cell types in multiple crypts in normal human biopsy specimens. This has provided the opportunity to produce a calibrated computational model that simulates cell dynamics in normal human crypts, and by changing model parameter values, to simulate the initiation and treatment of colon cancer.
Results: An agent-based model of stochastic cell dynamics in human colon crypts was developed in the multi-platform open-source application NetLogo. It was assumed that each cell's probability of proliferation and probability of death is determined by its position in two gradients along the crypt axis, a divide gradient and in a die gradient. A cell's type is not intrinsic, but rather is determined by its position in the divide gradient. Cell types are dynamic, plastic, and inter-convertible. Parameter values were determined for the shape of each of the gradients, and for a cell's response to the gradients. This was done by parameter sweeps that indicated the values that reproduced the measured number and variation of each cell type, and produced quasi-stationary stochastic dynamics. The behavior of the model was verified by its ability to reproduce the experimentally observed monocolonal conversion by neutral drift, the formation of adenomas resulting from mutations either at the top or bottom of the crypt, and by the robust ability of crypts to recover from perturbation by cytotoxic agents. One use of the virtual crypt model was demonstrated by evaluating different cancer chemotherapy and radiation scheduling protocols.
Conclusions: A virtual crypt has been developed that simulates the quasi-stationary stochastic cell dynamics of normal human colon crypts. It is unique in that it has been calibrated with measurements of human biopsy specimens, and it can simulate the variation of cell types in addition to the average number of each cell type. The utility of the model was demonstrated with in silico experiments that evaluated cancer therapy protocols. The model is available for others to conduct additional experiments.},

  abstract = {While the field of semiotics has been active since it was started by Peirce, it appears like the last decade has been especially productive with a number of important new concepts being developed within the biosemiotics community. The novel concept of the Semiotic scaffold by Hoffmeyer is an important addition that offers insight into the hardware requirements for bio-semiosis. As any type of semiosis must be dependent upon Semiotic scaffolds, I recently argued that the process of semiosis has to be divided into two separate processes of sign establishment and sign interpretation, and that misalignment between the two processes result in faulty sign interpretation and over-signification. Such faulty signs were forbidden in the sign classification system of Peirce, so I defined them as forbidden signs. Here I present an analysis of the forbidden sign categories with examples from Occult semiotics. I also show that biological semiosis offers examples of forbidden signs, where the faulty interpretation of signs may lead to decimation of whole evolutionary lines of organisms. A new concept of Evolutionary memory which is applicable to both human and biological semiosis is explained as the combination of two processes; one leading to diversity generation within semiotic scaffolds followed by a second process of decimation of faulty signs during selection in specific learning environments. The analysis suggests that forbidden signs are always used as early stages in the iterative sign establishment process during semiosis.},

  volume = {164},
  issn = {03032647},
  abstract = {The organic code concept and its operationalization by molecular codes have been introduced to study the semiotic nature of living systems. This contribution develops further the idea that the semantic capacity of a physical medium can be measured by assessing its ability to implement a code as a contingent mapping. For demonstration and evaluation, the approach is applied to a formal medium: elementary cellular automata (ECA). The semantic capacity is measured by counting the number of ways codes can be implemented. Additionally, a link to information theory is established by taking multivariate mutual information for quantifying contingency. It is shown how ECAs differ in their semantic capacities, how this is related to various ECA classifications, and how this depends on how a meaning is defined. Interestingly, if the meaning should persist for a certain while, the highest semantic capacity is found in CAs with apparently simple behavior, i.e., the fixed-point and two-cycle class. Synergy as a predictor for a CA's ability to implement codes can only be used if context implementing codes are common. For large context spaces with sparse coding contexts synergy is a weak predictor. Concluding, the approach presented here can distinguish CA-like systems with respect to their ability to implement contingent mappings. Applying this to physical systems appears straight forward and might lead to a novel physical property indicating how suitable a physical medium is to implement a semiotic system.},

  title = {Discrimination of Cell Cycle Phases in {{PCNA}}-Immunolabeled Cells},
  volume = {16},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Background
Protein function in eukaryotic cells is often controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Therefore, the correct assignment of cellular phenotypes to cell cycle phases is a crucial task in cell biology research. Nuclear proteins whose localization varies during the cell cycle are valuable and frequently used markers of cell cycle progression. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a protein which is involved in DNA replication and has cell cycle dependent properties. In this work, we present a tool to identify cell cycle phases and in particular, sub-stages of the DNA replication phase (S-phase) based on the characteristic patterns of PCNA distribution. Single time point images of PCNA-immunolabeled cells are acquired using confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopy. In order to discriminate different cell cycle phases, an optimized processing pipeline is proposed. For this purpose, we provide an in-depth analysis and selection of appropriate features for classification, an in-depth evaluation of different classification algorithms, as well as a comparative analysis of classification performance achieved with confocal versus widefield microscopy images.

Results
We show that the proposed processing chain is capable of automatically classifying cell cycle phases in PCNA-immunolabeled cells from single time point images, independently of the technique of image acquisition. Comparison of confocal and widefield images showed that for the proposed approach, the overall classification accuracy is slightly higher for confocal microscopy images.

Conclusion
Overall, automated identification of cell cycle phases and in particular, sub-stages of the DNA replication phase (S-phase) based on the characteristic patterns of PCNA distribution, is feasible for both confocal and widefield images.},

  abstract = {Flow simulation in a reservoir can be highly impacted by upscaling errors. These errors can be reduced by using simulation grids with cells as homogeneous as possible, hence conformable to horizons and faults. In this paper, the coordinates of 3D Voronoi seeds are optimized so that Voronoi cell facets honor the structural features. These features are modeled by piecewise linear complex (PLC). The optimization minimizes a function made of two parts: (1) a barycentric function, which ensures that the cells will be of good quality by maximizing their compactness; and (2) a conformity function, which allows to minimize the volume of cells that is isolated from the Voronoi seed w.r.t., a structural feature. To determine the isolated volume, a local approximation of the structural feature inside the Voronoi cells is used to cut the cells. It improves the algorithm efficiency and robustness compared to an exact cutting procedure. This method, used jointly with an adaptive gradient solver to minimize the function, allows dealing with complex 3D geological cases. It always produces a Voronoi simulation grid with the desired number of cells.},

  abstract = {Shannon's theory of communication has been very successfully applied for the analysis of biological information. However, the theory neglects semantic and pragmatic aspects and thus cannot directly be applied to distinguish between (bio-) chemical systems able to process ``meaningful'' information from those that do not. Here, we present a formal method to assess a system's semantic capacity by analyzing a reaction network's capability to implement molecular codes. We analyzed models of chemical systems (martian atmosphere chemistry and various combustion chemistries), biochemical systems (gene expression, gene translation, and phosphorylation signaling cascades), an artificial chemistry, and random reaction networks. Our study suggests that different chemical systems posses different semantic capacities. No semantic capacity was found in the model of the martian atmosphere chemistry, the studied combustion chemistries, and highly connected random networks, i.e. with these chemistries molecular codes cannot be implemented. High semantic capacity was found in the studied biochemical systems and in random reaction networks where the number of second order reactions is twice the number of species. We conclude that our approach can be applied to evaluate the information processing capabilities of a chemical system and may thus be a useful tool to understand the origin and evolution of meaningful information, e.g. in the context of the origin of life.},

  title = {Chance versus {{Randomness}}},
  abstract = {Randomness, as we ordinarily think of it, exists when some outcomes occur haphazardly, unpredictably, or by chance. These latter three notions are all distinct, but all have some kind of close connection to probability. Notoriously, there are many kinds of probability: subjective probabilities (`degrees of belief'), evidential probabilities, and objective chances, to name a few (H{\'a}jek 2012), and we might enquire into the connections between randomness and any of these species of probability.In this entry, we focus on the potential connections between randomness and chance, or physical probability. The ordinary way that the word `random' gets used is more or less interchangeable with `chancy', which suggests this Commonplace Thesis\textemdash{}a useful claim to target in our discussion:, The Commonplace Thesis, and the close connection between randomness and chance it proposes, appears also to be endorsed in the scientificliterature, as in this example from a popular textbook on evolution (which also throws in the notion of unpredictability for good measure):, Some philosophers are, no doubt, equally subject to this unthinkingelision, but others connect chance and randomness deliberately. Suppesapprovingly introduces, However a number of technical and philosophical advances in ourunderstanding of both chance and randomness open up the possibilitythat the easy slide between chance and randomness in ordinary andscientific usage\textemdash{}a slide that would be vindicated by the truth ofthe Commonplace Thesis\textemdash{}is quite misleading. This entry willattempt to spell out these developments and clarify the differencesbetween chance and randomness, as well as the areas in which theyoverlap in application. It will also aim to clarify the relationship ofchance and randomness to other important notions in the vicinity,particularly determinism and predictability (themselves often subjectto confusion)., There will be philosophically significant consequences if theCommonplace Thesis is incorrect, and if ordinary usage is misleading.For example, it is intuitively plausible that if an event is trulyrandom it cannot be explained (if it happens for a reason, it isn't truly random). It might seem then that the possibilityof probabilistic explanation is undermined when the probabilitiesinvolved are genuine chances. Yet this pessimistic conclusion onlyfollows under the assumption, derived from the Commonplace Thesis, thatall chancy outcomes are random. Another interesting case is the role ofrandom sampling in statistical inference. If randomness requireschance, then no statistical inferences on the basis of`randomly' sampling a large population will be valid unlessthe experimental design involves genuine chance in the selection ofsubjects. But the rationale for random sampling may not require chance sampling\textemdash{}as long as our sample is representative, thosestatistical inferences may be reliable. But inthat case, we'd be in a curious situation where random samplingwouldn't have much to do with randomness, and whatever justificationfor beliefs based on random sampling that randomness is currentlythought to provide would need to be replaced by something else., A final case of considerable philosophical interest is the frequentist approach to objective probability, which claims (roughly) that the chance of an outcome is its frequency in an appropriate series of outcomes (H{\'a}jek 2012 \textsection{}3.4). To avoid classifying perfectly regular recurring outcomes as chancy, frequentists like von Mises (1957) proposed to require that the series of outcomes should be random, without pattern or order. Frequentism may fall with the Commonplace Thesis: if there can be chancy outcomes without randomness, both will fail., The Commonplace Thesis is central to all three examples. As it is widely accepted that probabilistic explanation is legimitate, that random sampling doesn't need genuine chance (though it can help), and that frequentism is in serious trouble (H{\'a}jek 1997), there is already some some pressure on the CommonplaceThesis. But we must subject it to closer examination to clarifywhether these arguments do succeed, and what exactly it means to say ofsome event or process that it is random or chancy. Though developingfurther consequences of this kind is not the primary aim of this entry,it is hoped that what is said here may help to untangle these and othervexed issues surrounding chance and randomness.},

  title = {Bohmian {{Mechanics}}},
  abstract = {Bohmian mechanics, which is also called the de Broglie-Bohm theory,the pilot-wave model, and the causal interpretation of quantummechanics, is a version of quantum theory discovered by Louis deBroglie in 1927 and rediscovered by David Bohm in 1952. It is thesimplest example of what is often called a hidden variablesinterpretation of quantum mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics a system ofparticles is described in part by its wave function, evolving, asusual, according to Schr{\"o}dinger's equation. However, thewave function provides only a partial description of the system. Thisdescription is completed by the specification of the actual positionsof the particles. The latter evolve according to the ``guiding equation'', which expresses the velocities of the particles in terms of the wavefunction. Thus, in Bohmian mechanics the configuration of a system ofparticles evolves via a deterministic motion choreographed by the wavefunction. In particular, when a particle is sent into a two-slitapparatus, the slit through which it passes and its location uponarrival on the photographic plate are completely determined by itsinitial position and wave function., Bohmian mechanics inherits and makes explicit the nonlocality implicitin the notion, common to just about all formulations andinterpretations of quantum theory, of a wave function on theconfiguration space of a many-particle system. It accounts for all ofthe phenomena governed by nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, fromspectral lines and scattering theory to superconductivity, the quantumHall effect and quantum computing. In particular, the usualmeasurement postulates of quantum theory, including collapse of thewave function and probabilities given by the absolute square ofprobability amplitudes, emerge from an analysis of the two equationsof motion: Schr{\"o}dinger's equation and the guiding equation.No invocation of a special, and somewhat obscure, status forobservation is required.},

Though the purpose of such propositions was to confer actionable certainty to particular legal effects, the later tradition imagined the main charge of u{\d s}{\=u}l al-fiqh on a meta-theoretic level, i.e., to determine how such propositions could themselves be suitably grounded. In casting the discourse within the framework of naturalized technical methods and distinctions from fields of logic and philosophy, the tradition generally granted the relational and systemic validity of each proposition in terms of the grounding it received from another underdetermined proposition. This second-order perspective of the tradition reveals that u{\d s}{\=u}l were systemically and relationally valid, but individually underdetermined. Thus the application of the attribute of relational validity to them and to the effects for which they are serviceable is apt.},

One example is the role of Ca2+ in the cell body and overall compartmentalization and regulation of Ca2+ within the cell. The recent development of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques has made it possible to rapidly and cheaply alter specific genes. This will help to define the biological function of elusive processes that have been more challenging to study. CRISPR/Cas9 has been optimized in many systems including zebrafish, which already has some distinct advantages for studying photoreceptor biology and function. These new genome editing technologies and the continued use of the zebrafish model system will help advance our understanding of important understudied aspects of photoreceptor biology.},

I compare Barbour's taxonomy with the theories of four authors who, in the last four decades, have addressed the relationship between science and religion from a Muslim perspective. The aim of my analysis is twofold. First, I offer a comparative perspective to the debate on science and Islam. Second, following Barbour's suggestion, I test the general applicability of his categories by comparing them with a discourse on science and religion that is not focused on Christianity. In the first section, I reconstruct Barbour's typologies, recalling some major objections to them, and arguing why despite the latter, Barbour's model is employed for the present analysis. I also reconstruct Barbour's parallel model for the relationships between different religions. In the second section, I reconstruct the discourse on science and religion developed by the Palestinian-American scholar Ismail Raji al-Faruqi. The third section is devoted to the ideas of the Persian-American scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr. In the fourth section, I examine the views of the Iranian author Mehdi Golshani. The fifth section reconstructs the theories of the Algerian author Nidhal Guessoum. In the final section, I argue that a generalized use of the ``integration'' concept to refer to the entire debate on Islam and science is unhelpful. While these positions do not appear to instantiate Barbourian integration of science and religion, they do move toward what Barbour (skeptically) describes as integration between religions.},

  title = {The {{Islamic Understanding}} of {{Prayer}}},
  abstract = {Du`a, the Arabic word for prayer or supplication, is the calling of a servant to His Deity. Summoning to God is highly encouraged in Islam, as prayer is considered to be the essence of worship. But what exactly is sincere supplication, and what do we achieve from it? How do we ensure a response from God, and what prevents a prayer from being accepted? This article explores the stages of a sincere prayer, as well as explaining its importance, etiquette, and conditions to enable one to acquire moral virtues, improve one's self-discipline and intellect, add brightness to the heart, and above all, achieve nearness to God.},

  title = {Representing {{Canadian Muslims}}: {{Media}}, {{Muslim Advocacy Organizations}}, and {{Gender}} in the {{Ontario Shari}}'ah {{Debate}}},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes a highly public conflict between two Muslim non-profit organizations, the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) and the Muslim Canadian Congress (MCC), as it played out on the pages of Canadian newspapers and Internet websites. Sparked by profoundly divergent convictions about gender norms and fuelled by contradictory blueprints for ``being Muslim in Canada'', this incendiary conflict was fanned by Canadian media coverage. Focusing especially, but not exclusively, on the 2003-2005 debate over Shari'ah-based alternative dispute resolution in Ontario, I will argue that the media have played a role in constructing internal Muslim debates and identity negotiations concerning what it means to be genuinely Canadian and authentically Muslim through controversydriven journalism that has highlighted opposing ends of a liberal/progressive versus conservative/traditional axis in a search for ``point/counter-point'' views. Through short stories and commentaries on controversial topics that juxtapose two increasingly antagonistic organizational voices, the media have not merely reflected Muslim realities, but also helped to shape them and, more often than not, reinforce polarization between a ``majority Muslim'' culture seeking to secure space for itself within Canadian society and a ``dissident Muslim'' culture that seeks to consolidate external support for internal change.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, skeptics of the reality and significance of anthropogenic climate change have frequently accused climate scientists of ``alarmism'': of over-interpreting or overreacting to evidence of human impacts on the climate system. However, the available evidence suggests that scientists have in fact been conservative in their projections of the impacts of climate change. In particular, we discuss recent studies showing that at least some of the key attributes of global warming from increased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of the physical science, by Working Group I. We also note the less frequent manifestation of over-prediction of key characteristics of climate in such assessments. We suggest, therefore, that scientists are biased not toward alarmism but rather the reverse: toward cautious estimates, where we define caution as erring on the side of less rather than more alarming predictions. We call this tendency ``erring on the side of least drama (ESLD).'' We explore some cases of ESLD at work, including predictions of Arctic ozone depletion and the possible disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and suggest some possible causes of this directional bias, including adherence to the scientific norms of restraint, objectivity, skepticism, rationality, dispassion, and moderation. We conclude with suggestions for further work to identify and explore ESLD.},

  shorttitle = {Climate Change Projections for {{Ontario}}},
  abstract = {This publication is intended to help planners and policymakers in Ontario account for the potential impacts of climate change on people, infrastructure, and the environment. This overview of Ontario's future climate is based on the Canadian Coupled Global Circulation Model and uses two scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity in the 21st century, the A2 and the B2 scenarios. The A2 scenario projects future greenhouse gas concentrations reaching the equivalent of 1,320 ppm CO2 by the year 2100 (pre-industrial levels were about 330 ppm). In an A2 world before the end of the century, summers in most of southern Ontario will on average be 5oC hotter and 20\% less rain will fall from April to September compared with the period 1971-2000. Winters in some southern Ontario locations will be up to 6oC warmer, with 10 to 20\% reductions in precipitation from October to March. In northern Ontario, temperatures in the A2 scenario will warm by up to 10oC in winter and 6oC in summer, with greatest warming adjacent to Hudson Bay. Large parts of the north will receive less precipitation, particularly in winter in areas near the Manitoba and Quebec borders. Up to 20\% less summer precipitation will fall in the western half of northwestern Ontario by the end of the century. The B2 scenario is based on lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to scenario A2, with the atmosphere reaching the equivalent of 915 ppm CO2 by 2100. As a result, the rate of climate change in a B2 world will be significant but less than if the A2 scenario comes about. In 2071-2100, for example, the B2 world will see 3 to 5oC warming in southern Ontario in summer and 4 to 5oC warming in winter compared with 1971-2000. Most of southern Ontario will receive up to 10\% less precipitation during the warm season and up to 20\% less precipitation in winter. In northern Ontario in 2071-2100, summers will warm by 3 to 5oC and winters by 4 to 9oC compared to 19712000. Temperature increases will be greatest in the far north. In the B2 world, much of northern Ontario will be considerably drier than in 1971-2000, with annual precipitation reduced by up to 10\% in much of the northwest and some areas receiving 20 to 30\% less cold season precipitation.},

  abstract = {Cahokia, the largest pre-European settlement in North America, was situated on the Middle Mississippi River floodplain and flourished for approximately three hundred years from the 10th century AD onward. The site was favorably located from an environmental standpoint, being proximal to a diversity of microhabitats including expanses of open water and marshes from which the essential, renewable fish protein could be procured. More importantly, the largest local zone of soils characterized as optimal for prehistoric hoe cultivation lay immediately to the east. Here, on the floodplain and along its bordering alluvial fans, the large maize outfields were situated, while the multi-crop house gardens were placed within the habitation zone on soils that had often been culturally enriched by prior occupation. As successful as this strategy might have been for small, dispersed populations in such a plentiful environment, nucleation of large numbers of people at Cahokia provided a different adaptive context that ultimately led to ruinous consequences. The seeds for the city's destruction centered anthropogenically produced environmental degradation. Demands on wood resources for fuel and construction were enormous and agricultural field clearance was in forested rather than prairie settings. The resultant watershed deforestation produced greatly increased rates of erosion, runoff, and unseasonable downstream flooding during the summer growing season. The economic and social consequences of declining production and localized crop failures proved disastrous for this city of farmers.},

We use the theoretical frameworks of disputed material and immaterial territories and of re-peasantization to explain the increased emphasis on agroecology by movements in this context. We provide examples from the farmer-to-farmer movement to show the advantages that social movements bring to the table in taking agroecology to scale and discuss the growing agroecology networking process in the transnational peasant and family farmer movement La V{\'i}a Campesina.},

We predict changes in social organization, political complexity, and patterns of stylistic similarity. As the environmental background for our model we employ recently published moisture data. By iteratively applying the synchronic Winterhalder\textendash{}Kelly model we are able to predict a sequence of general trends that agree with much current interpretation of Fort Ancient development. Specifically, the model leads us to expect increasing village size, the development of regional traditions, and the development of leadership roles and a region-wide style Horizon around AD 1400. However, our model provides the ability to make testable predictions that deviate from the accepted cultural history and predicts that the Middle Ohio Valley and the groups referred to as Fort Ancient were far from homogenous.},

  abstract = {Scholarly debates on sustainable consumption have generally overlooked alternative agro-food networks in the economies outside of Western Europe and North America. Building on practice-based theories, this article focuses on informal raw milk markets in post-socialist Lithuania to examine how such alternative systems emerge and operate in the changing political, social, and economic contexts. It makes two contributions to the scholarship on sustainable consumption. In considering semi-subsistence practices and poverty-driven consumption, this article argues for a richer, more critical, and inclusive theory of sustainability that takes into consideration vernacular forms of exchange and approaches poor consumers as subjects of global history. Second, it revisits practice theories and infrastructures of consumption approaches to consider ruptures, discontinuities, and historical change in infrastructures as a way to account for inequalities and experiences of marginalization.},

According to several observers, fossil fuel production is about to peak, i.e., oil extraction is no longer capable of keeping pace with the increasing demand. This situation may trigger an unprecedented increase in fossil energy prices, which makes the entire food production-distribution system highly vulnerable. The paper starts with a survey of these dependencies. An analysis, based on Swedish official statistics and energy future discussions on Internet, indicates that its sustainability is highly questionable.},

Are they sufficiently aware of their farm system that they are able to represent it in the form of a map? The research reported describes how causal mapping was applied to sheep/beef farmers in New Zealand and shows that farmers can create maps of their farm systems in ways that allow expression of both individual maps and the formation of group maps which represent the general character of farm systems. A group map was made for all the farmers studied and for subgroups using conventional, integrated, and organic management systems. The results are discussed in terms of the depth of meaning associated with individual elements of the map, map complexity and the limitations of causal mapping. Causal mapping has the potential to contribute to our knowledge of how farmers see their farm systems, and this can benefit farmers and other stakeholders concerned with the management of farms and their economic and environmental performance.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {0889-048X},
  abstract = {Native food production in the Eastern Woodlands of North America before, and at the time of, European contact has been described by several writers as ``slash-and-burn agriculture,'' ``shifting cultivation,'' and even ``swidden.'' Select quotes from various early explorers, such as John Smith of Pocahontas fame, have been used out of context to support this position. Solid archaeological evidence of such practices is next to nonexistent, as are ethnographic parallels from the region. In reality, the best data are documentary. Unlike previous assessments, this paper evaluates sixteenth and seventeenth century ethnohistorical references to anything that can be even remotely construed as supportive of previous claims. Analyzed as a group these sources reveal something completely different from what common knowledge would have us believe. References to the slashing, the burning, and the shifting of fields are reasonably abundant. Rarely, however, are all three activities mentioned in a single passage, or by one chronicler. Furthermore, subtleties often overlooked in these quotes reveal great insight into native practices. This paper assesses explorers' and early settlers' descriptions in the context of the larger body of literature dealing with the ecology of swidden agriculture today. Indigenous fields in the Eastern Woodlands tended to be large, numerous, contiguous, and cleared of roots and stumps. Fields previously cleared of trees were covered with grass prior to preparation for planting. They were permanently cultivated. This condition stands in marked contrast to present-day swidden fields in other parts of the world that tend to be small, few, scattered, partially cleared of trees, and cultivated for only a year or two before being abandoned. Slash-and-burn shifting cultivation became common only after European settlers introduced steel axes. It was then practiced on uplands, not the formerly cultivated floodplains that were usurped by interlopers.},

This case study of Waterloo Region (WR), Canada, had two objectives. First, we estimate the quantity of locally grown vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains needed to help meet the Region of Waterloo population's optimal nutritional requirements currently and in 2026. Secondly, we estimate how much of these healthy food requirements for the WR population could realistically be produced through local agriculture by the year 2026. Results show that a shift of approximately 10\% of currently cropped hectares to the production of key nutritious foods would be both agriculturally feasible and nutritionally significant to the growing population. We supplement our findings with some agronomic considerations and community-level strategies that would inform and support such change. The methodology of this study could be applied to other regions: more such analyses would create a broader picture of the diverse qualitative and quantitative agricultural shifts that could synchronize optimal land use with dietary recommendations, thus informing coordinated policy and planning.},

Yet, despite its popularity or perhaps because of it, local food (especially in the US) is also something of a chimera if not a tool of the status quo. This paper reflects on and contrasts aspects of current local food rhetoric with Dalhberg's notion of a regenerative food system. It identifies three problematic emphases\textemdash{}the locavore emphasis, the Wal-Mart emphasis, and the Pollan emphasis\textemdash{}and argues that they are shifting local food (as a concept and a social movement) away from the deeper concerns of equity, citizenship, place-building, and sustainability. It is suggested that local food activists and advocates might consider the use of multiple methodologies and forms of expression to explore the integration and reintegration of local food into diverse and redundant place-based practice. A short case study of a low-income, urban neighborhood in Lansing, Michigan, illustrates the value of contextual analysis for more fully enabling the local food movement and a regenerative food system.},

Flowering is the best characterized of these seasonal responses, and in temperate climates it often occurs in spring. Genetic approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana have shown how the underlying responses to changes in day length (photoperiod) or winter temperature (vernalization) are conferred and how these converge to create a robust seasonal response. Recent advances in plant genome analysis have demonstrated the diversity in these regulatory systems in many plant species, including several crops and perennials, such as poplar trees. Here, we report progress in defining the diverse genetic mechanisms that enable plants to recognize winter, spring and autumn to initiate flower development.},

  abstract = {Tidal energy has the potential to play a valuable part in a sustainable energy future. It is an extremely predictable energy source, depending only on the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun and the centrifugal forces created by the rotation of the earth\textendash{}moon system. Tidal energy has been exploited on a significant scale since the construction of the La Rance tidal barrage in France in 1967. A tidal barrage utilises the potential energy of the tide and has proven to be very successful, despite opposition from environmental groups. Kinetic energy can also be harnessed from tidal currents to generate electricity and involves the use of a tidal current turbine. This is the more desired method of capturing the energy in the tides. However, tidal current turbine technology is currently not economically viable on a large scale, as it is still in an early stage of development. This paper provides an up-to-date review of the status of tidal energy technology and identifies some of the key barriers challenging the development of tidal energy. The future development of tidal current devices and tidal barrage systems is discussed as well as examining the importance of a supportive policy to assist development.},

  shorttitle = {Japan's Hiropon Panic},
  abstract = {Background: This qualitative historical policy analysis explores Japan's early postwar market for hiropon (methamphetamine/meth) and the impact of its anti-hiropon campaigns. The paper traces the origins of medical methamphetamine production in prewar Japan; known at that time by its former brand-name, `Philopon' (pronounced hiropon), and argues that the anti-meth `shock-horror' campaigns of the 1950s were exacerbated by long-simmering animosity toward non-Japanese residents \textendash{} especially Koreans and Taiwanese.
Methods: Through an analysis of both English- and Japanese-language source materials, the paper explores the gritty, frightening themes of Japan's 1950s-era anti-meth propaganda campaigns and the parallel effort by police to arrest, prosecute, and deport members of the resident Korean and Taiwanese communities.
Results: The author demonstrates that by incorporating a wider variety of contemporary Japaneselanguage sources such as news reports and anti-drug propaganda materials about the postwar hiropon trade, we may more fully appreciate the historic, underlying social tensions behind the swift and targeted public response.
Conclusion: The author concludes that Japan's postwar federal and municipal governments, together with police and media agencies, cultivated a sensational `drug panic' designed both to dissuade citizens from using hiropon and to fuel a concerted police campaign against non-Japanese involved in the meth trade.

  shorttitle = {Collapse and {{Reorganization}} in {{Social}}-{{Ecological Systems}}},
  abstract = {We tested the explanatory usefulness and policy relevance of Holling's (2001) ``adaptive cycle'' theory in exploring processes of ``collapse,'' also called ``release,`` and recovery in regional socialecological systems (SESs) in Zimbabwe and Australia. We found that the adaptive cycle is useful in recognizing changes in system behavior during the various phases. However, our small sample of cases did not generally show either the sequential passage of stages or the prerelease decline in resilience that adaptive cycle theory implies. In all cases, however, the reasons for releases were apparent with hindsight. On the other hand, our examples mostly supported the proposition that resilience is controlled by slowly changing variables. Although we found the adaptive cycle, and complex system theory in general, to be useful integrating frameworks, disciplinary theories are required to explain causes and effects in specific cases. We used theories linking distribution of political power to institutional change; to investment in natural, human, social, and physical capitals; and to access to financial capital. We explored patterns of change of these capitals before, during, and after release and reorganization. Both the patterns of change and relative importance of the different capitals during reorganization varied widely, but the importation of resources from broader scales was often a key to recovery. We propose that the resilience of most regional or national SESs can be explained in these terms. The capacity to self-organize emerged from our studies as a critical source of resilience. Although rebuilding this capacity at times requires access to external resources, excessive subsidization can reduce the capacity to self-organize. The policy implication is that cross-scale subsidization should end when self-organization becomes apparent, because subsidization can increase the vulnerability of the system as a whole. When the aim is to recover without changing the system fundamentally, the focus should be upon conserving or investing in the elements of capital critical for this. If the current system is not viable, it is necessary to invest in forms of capital that will enable fundamental change. It will also be necessary to stop investing in the capitals that maintained the unviable regime. The political difficulty of doing this is why SESs so often remain maladapted to current conditions and opportunities and eventually reach the point of collapse.},

Though I consider the Colombian guerrillas, these findings are not necessarily case-specific. I argue that socio-psychological motivations at the individual level may be the most significant reason for joining, surpassing in importance grievance-based, ideological and even economic motivations. Moreover, I find that the lack of cohesion inside the Colombian guerrillas may boost economic motivations, further weakening insurgents' commitment to the pursuit of political power, and to the improvement of the socio-political position of those they claim to represent. This type of research contributes to a greater understanding of those in armed groups and it provides insights for developing focused recruitment prevention programs. It also contributes to the growing literature that explores the meaning and character of insurgencies, and possibly terrorist organizations.},

  abstract = {In 1972, the Club of Rome's infamous report ``The Limits to Growth'' (Meadows et al., 1972) presented some challenging scenarios for global sustainability, based on a system dynamics computer model to simulate the interactions of five global economic subsystems, namely: population, food production, industrial production, pollution, and consumption of non-renewable natural resources. Contrary to popular belief, The Limits to Growth scenarios by the team of analysts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did not predict world collapse by the end of the 20th Century. This paper focuses on a comparison of recently collated historical data for 1970\textendash{}2000 with scenarios presented in the Limits to Growth. The analysis shows that 30 years of historical data compares favorably with key features of a business-as-usual scenario called the ``standard run'' scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st Century. The data does not compare well with other scenarios involving comprehensive use of technology or stabilizing behaviour and policies. The results indicate the particular importance of understanding and controlling global pollution.},

  abstract = {During the 18th century, raising the ``nezumi'' rodent became so prevalent in Japan that two guidebooks were published on the topic. The first guidebook was entitled Yosotama-no-kakehashi (1775) and the second was entitled Chinganso-date-gusa (1787). It remains unclear in these texts whether the term nezumi was used to refer to the rat (Rattus norvegicus) or the mouse (Mus musculus). In this review, I explore Yoso-tama-no-kakehashi (English translation: A bridge to obtaining novel jewel-like nezumi). It was written by the owner of ``Shunpo-do'' and comprises two volumes; the first is 34 pages in length and the second is 14 pages. It introduces the nezumi and then provides details on novel varieties and the methods that were used to raise them. The nezumi dwells in peoples' homes. It is noteworthy that the ``norako'' species is classified in the same group as the nezumi. The norako is smaller than the nezumi. Its alias is ``hatsuka-nezumi'', a term which is still used in Japan today when referring to the mouse. This indicates that when the guidebook was written people distinguished the rat from the mouse by identifying the rat using the word nezumi and the mouse using the word norako. Moreover, I recently confirmed that the rat varieties which are introduced in Yoso-tama-no-kakehashi, such as ``white'', ``spotted'', ``black bear-like'', ``deer-spotted'', and ``cracked-mark'', can be found in modern laboratory rats. Taken together, it is very likely that the term nezumi is used to refer to the rat in Yoso-tama-nokakehashi and that this was indeed a guidebook on the rat.},

By examining the Welsh settlement evidence from the late Bronze and Iron Age, and comparing it with linguistic evidence, a model of the evolution of Welsh Iron Age societies is presented. This model, in turn, can be compared to a wider `Celtic' social metanarrative, which both is informed by and informs the more local Welsh narrative, and allows broader comparisons with other Iron Age societies in Europe and human social evolutionary models in general.},

A proposed source of transcriptional noise is transcriptional bursting although other sources of heterogeneity, such as unequal separation of cell contents at mitosis are also likely to contribute considerably. Bursting transcription, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, reflects multiple states of gene activity, with fluctuations between states separated by irregular intervals, generating uneven protein expression between cells. Noise in gene expression can have tremendous consequences on cell behaviour, and must be mitigated or integrated. In certain contexts, such as establishment of viral latency, the survival of microbes in rapidly changing stressful environments, or several types of scattered differentiation, the variability may be essential. Variability also impacts upon the effectiveness of clinical treatment, with resistance of bacteria to antibiotics demonstrably caused by non-genetic differences. Variability in gene expression may also contribute to resistance of sub-populations of cancer cells to chemotherapy  and appears to be a barrier to curing HIV .},

  title = {Quantum Fluctuation},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In quantum physics, a quantum fluctuation (or vacuum state fluctuation or vacuum fluctuation) is the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space, as explained in Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
This allows the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs of virtual particles. The effects of these particles are measurable, for example, in the effective charge of the electron, different from its "naked" charge.
Quantum fluctuations may have been very important in the origin of the structure of the universe: according to the model of expansive inflation the ones that existed when inflation began were amplified and formed the seed of all current observed structure. Vacuum energy may also be responsible for the current accelerating expansion of the universe (cosmological constant).
According to one formulation of the principle, energy and time can be related by the relation

  
    
      
        {$\Delta$}
        E
        {$\Delta$}
        t

In the modern view, energy is always conserved, but because the particle number operator does not commute with a field's Hamiltonian or energy operator, the field's lowest-energy or ground state, often called the vacuum state, is not, as one might expect from that name, a state with no particles, but rather a quantum superposition of particle number eigenstates with 0, 1, 2...etc. particles.},

  title = {Ergodic Hypothesis},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In physics and thermodynamics, the ergodic hypothesis says that, over long periods of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are equiprobable over a long period of time.
Liouville's Theorem states that, for Hamiltonian systems, the local density of microstates following a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer moving with the ensemble (i.e., the convective time derivative is zero). Thus, if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem does not imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.
The ergodic hypothesis is often assumed in the statistical analysis of computational physics. The analyst would assume that the average of a process parameter over time and the average over the statistical ensemble are the same. This assumption that it is as good to simulate a system over a long time as it is to make many independent realizations of the same system is not always correct. (See, for example, the Fermi\textendash{}Pasta\textendash{}Ulam\textendash{}Tsingou experiment of 1953.)
Assumption of the ergodic hypothesis allows proof that certain types of perpetual motion machines of the second kind are impossible. The figure above displays situations where the ergodic hypothesis does and does not hold for a simplistic model of an ideal gas. If the walls are perfectly smooth and circular, the ergodic hypothesis does not hold. If it was possible to construct a sort of tunnel whereby specular reflections cause atoms to move from a less populated container to an identical one with greater density, this would allow the direct conversion of random thermal energy into useful work in a way that does not require a heat bath. But, by Liouville's theorem, if all regions of phase space are equally populated at time, t=0, then they are equally probable for all time. No reflective 'trap' or Maxwell's demon (such as depicted in the figure) will 'unmix' a gas that has randomly filled both containers with equal density and pressure.},

  abstract = {Extrinsic cues and intrinsic competence act in concert for cell fate determination in the developing vertebrate retina. However, what controls competence and how precise is the control are largely unknown. We studied the regulation of competence by examining the order in which individual retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) generate daughters. Experiments were performed in Xenopus laevis, whose full complement of retinal cells is formed in 2 days. We lineage-labeled RPCs at the optic vesicle stage. Subsequently we administered a cell cycle marker, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at early, middle or late periods of retinogenesis. Under these conditions, and in this animal, BrdU is not cleared by the time of analysis, allowing cumulative labeling. All retinal cell types were generated throughout nearly the entire retinogenesis period. When we examined the order that individual RPCs generated daughters, we discovered a regular and consistent sequence according to phenotype: RGC, Ho, CPr, RPr, Am, BP, MG. The precision of the order between the clones supports a model in which RPCs proceed through stepwise changes in competence to make each cell type, and do so unidirectionally. Because every cell type can be generated simultaneously within the same retinal environment, the change in RPC competence is likely to be autonomous.},

Each half of the compound eye appears to spread its connexions across the entire extent of the (apparently normal) contralateral tectum. This could indicate a certain plasticity in the way in which optic fibres can connect with the tectum. Alternatively, it is conceivable that each (similar) half of the compound eye is only able to innervate its corresponding halftectum; in which case the uninnervated half-tectum could remain undeveloped and the innervated half-tectum could overgrow to resemble a normal tectum. This mechanism would preserve the idea of a rigidly fixed cell-to-cell specificity between retina and tectum.},

Here, we show it is also essential for vascularization and lamination. Despite minimal effects on Hif1a target expression, intraretinal vascular plexi did not form in the Rb-/- murine retina. Deleting adenovirus E2 promoter binding factor 3 (E2f3), which rescues starburst amacrine cell differentiation, or E2f2, had no effect, but deleting E2f1, which promotes neuronal cell cycle exit and survival, restored retinal vasculature. We specifically linked cell loss to the defect because removing Bax rescued rod and bipolar neurons and the vasculature, but not cell cycle exit. Despite rescuing Rb-/- neurons, Bax deletion exacerbated a delay in outer retina lamination, and exposed a requirement for Rb in inner retina lamination. The latter resembled Sem5 or FAT atypical cadherin 3 (Fat3) mutants, but expression of Sem5/Fat3 pathway components, or that of Neogenin, which perturbs migration in the Rb-/- cortex, was unchanged. Instead, lamination defects correlated with ectopic division, and were E2f1-dependent, implicating the cell cycle machinery. These in vivo studies expose new developmental roles for Rb, pinpoint aberrant E2f1 and Bax activity in neuronal death and vascular loss, and further implicate E2f1 in defective lamination. Links between Rb, angiogenesis and lamination have implications for the treatment of neovascularization, neurodegeneration and cancer.},

Cell proliferation leading to the formation of neurons is restricted to the retinal margin at the ora terminalis. New retina is added in concentric rings, with slightly more growth dorsonasally. The rate of cell addition is variable, averaging 12,000 cells/day. These new cells account for about 20\% of the total increase in retinal area; the remaining 80\% is due to hypertrophy, or expansion, of the retina. In contrast to all of the other retinal cells, the rods do not appear to participate in the retinal expansion. This hypothesized immobility of the rods would create a shearing strain between the retinal layers resulting in a shift in their position relative to the other cells. Were they to maintain synaptic contacts with the same horizontal and bipolar cells, the rod axons would have to be elongated peripherally or the post-synaptic cell dendrites displaced centrally. Since neurons with this morphology have not been found in the goldfish retina, these observations suggest that the rods must be changing their synaptic connections as the retina grows.},

  abstract = {The physical contact of optic vesicle with head surface ectoderm is an initial event triggering eye morphogenesis. This interaction leads to lens specification followed by coordinated invagination of the lens placode and optic vesicle, resulting in formation of the lens, retina and retinal pigmented epithelium. Although the role of Pax6 in early lens development has been well documented, its role in optic vesicle neuroepithelium and early retinal progenitors is poorly understood. Here we show that conditional inactivation of Pax6 at distinct time points of mouse neuroretina development has a different impact on early eye morphogenesis. When Pax6 is eliminated in the retina at E10.5 using an mRx-Cre transgene, after a sufficient contact between the optic vesicle and surface ectoderm has occurred, the lens develops normally but the pool of retinal progenitor cells gradually fails to expand. Furthermore, a normal differentiation program is not initiated, leading to almost complete disappearance of the retina after birth. By contrast, when Pax6 was inactivated at the onset of contact between the optic vesicle and surface ectoderm in Pax6Sey/flox embryos, expression of lens-specific genes was not initiated and neither the lens nor the retina formed. Our data show that Pax6 in the optic vesicle is important not only for proper retina development, but also for lens formation in a non-cell-autonomous manner.},

  abstract = {The nuclear landscape plays an important role in the regulation of tissue and positional specific genes in embryonic and developing cells. Changes in this landscape can be dynamic, and are associated with the differentiation of cells during embryogenesis, and the de-differentiation of cells during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) formation and in many cancers. However, tools to quantitatively characterize these changes are limited, especially in the in vivo context, where numerous tissue types are present and cells are arranged in multiple layers. Previous tools have been optimized for the monolayer nature of cultured cells. Therefore, we present a new algorithm to quantify the condensation of chromatin in two in vivo systems. We first developed this algorithm to quantify changes in chromatin compaction and validated it in differentiating spermatids in zebrafish testes. Our algorithm successfully detected the typical increase in chromatin compaction as these cells differentiate. We then employed the algorithm to quantify the changes that occur in amphibian limb cells as they participate in a regenerative response. We observed that the chromatin in the limb cells de-compacts as they contribute to the regenerating organ.

  abstract = {Cell lineage tracing is used to study embryo development, stem cell differentiation, and to document tumor cell heterogeneity. Cre recombinase-mediated cell labelling is the preferred approach; however, its utility is restricted by when and where DNA recombination takes place. We generated a photoactivatable Cre recombinase by replacing a critical residue in its active site with a photocaged lysine derivative through genetic code expansion in zebrafish embryos. This allows for high spatiotemporal control of DNA recombination using 405 nm light. Importantly, no background activity is seen before irradiation, and after light-triggered removal of the caging group, Cre recombinase activity is restored. We demonstrate the utility of this tool as a cell lineage tracer through activation in different regions and at different time-points in the early embryo. Direct control of Cre recombinase with light will allow for more precise DNA recombination for more nuanced studies of metazoan development and disease.},

  abstract = {Chromatin is the template for the basic processes of replication and transcription, making the maintenance of chromosomal integrity critical for cell viability. To elucidate how dividing cells respond to alterations in chromatin structure, here we analyse the replication programme of primary cells with altered chromatin configuration caused by the genetic ablation of the HMGB1 gene, or three histone H1 genes. We find that loss of chromatin compaction in H1-depleted cells triggers the accumulation of stalled forks and DNA damage as a consequence of transcription-replication conflicts. In contrast, reductions in nucleosome occupancy due to the lack of HMGB1 cause faster fork progression without impacting the initiation landscape or fork stability. Thus, perturbations in chromatin integrity elicit a range of responses in the dynamics of DNA replication and transcription, with different consequences on replicative stress. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of how defects in chromatin structure contribute to genomic instability.},

  shorttitle = {The Flexible Stem Hypothesis},
  abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to distinct environmental conditions, is widely observed in the wild. It is believed to facilitate evolution and, under the Bflexible stem hypothesis\^, it is thought that an ancestral plastic species can be at the origin of sister lineages with divergent phenotypes fixed by genetic assimilation of alternative morphs. We review here the genetic mechanisms underlying such phenomenon. We show several examples in which the same gene shows transcriptional plasticity in response to environmental factors and divergence of expression within or between species. Thus, the same gene is involved both in the plasticity of a trait and in the evolution of that trait. In a few cases, it can be traced down to cis-regulatory variation in this gene and, in one case, in the very same regulatory sequence whose activity is modulated by the environment. These data are compatible with the Bflexible stem hypothesis\^ and also suggest that the evolution of the plasticity of a trait and the evolution of the trait are not completely uncoupled as they often involve the same locus. Furthermore, the Bflexible stem hypothesis\^ implies that it is possible to canalize initially plastic phenotypes. Several studies have shown that it was possible through modification of chromatin regulation or hormonal signalling/response. Further studies of phenotypic plasticity in an evolutionary framework are needed to see how much the findings described in this review can be generalized.},

In the nervous system, nuclear migration is prominent during both proliferative and post-mitotic phases of development. Interkinetic nuclear migration is the process where the nucleus oscillates from the apical to basal surfaces in proliferative neuroepithelia. Proliferative nuclear movement occurs in step with the cell cycle, with M-phase being confined to the apical surface and G1-, S-, and G2-phases occurring at more basal locations. Later, following cell cycle exit, some neuron precursors migrate by nuclear translocation. In this mode of cellular migration, nuclear movement is the driving force for motility. Following discussion of the key components and important regulators for each of these processes, we present an emerging model where interkinetic nuclear migration functions to distinguish cell fates among retinal neuroepithelia.},

A majority of those who spoke and presented posters at the meeting contributed to this volume. The Symposium addressed the blinding diseases of inherited retinal degenerations, which have no effective treatments, and age-related macular degeneration, which has no cures, despite the fact that it is an epidemic among the elderly, with 1 in 3-4 affected by the age of 75. The RD2014 Symposium focused on the exciting new developments aimed at understanding these diseases and providing therapies for them. The volume presents representative state-of-the-art research in almost all areas of retinal degenerations, ranging from cytopathologic, physiologic, diagnostic and clinical aspects; animal models; mechanisms of cell death; molecular genetics; and developing potential therapeutic measures such as gene therapy and neuroprotective agents for potential pharmaceutical therapy; and several sight restoration approaches, including optogenetics. While advances in these areas of retinal degenerations are included, several new topics either were in their infancy or did not exist at the time of the last RD Symposium, RD2012. These include many new developments in sight restoration using optogenetics, retinal or RPE cell transplantation, stem cell approaches and visual prosthetic devices. In addition, major advances are presented in other basic mechanisms in age-related macular degeneration, several new aspects of gene and antioxidant therapy, and revolutionary new imaging and functional testing that will have a huge impact on the diagnosis and following the course of retinal degenerations, as well as to provide new quantitative endpoints for clinical trials. The retina is an approachable part of the central nervous system (CNS), and there is a major interest in neuroprotective and gene therapy for CNS diseases and neurodegenerations, in general. It should be noted that with successful and exciting initial clinical trials in neuroprotective and gene therapy, including the restoration of sight in blind children, the retinal degeneration therapies are leading the way towards new therapeutic measures for neurodegenerations of the CNS. Many of the successes recently reported in these areas of retinal degeneration sprang from collaborations established at previous RD Symposia, and many of those are reported at the RD2014 meeting and included in this volume.},

  abstract = {To gain insights into the cellular mechanisms of neurogenesis, we analyzed retinal neuroepithelia deficient for Llgl1, a protein implicated in apicobasal cell polarity, asymmetric cell division, cell shape and cell cycle exit. We found that vertebrate retinal neuroepithelia deficient for Llgl1 retained overt apicobasal polarity, but had expanded apical domains. Llgl1 retinal progenitors also had increased Notch activity and reduced rates of neurogenesis. Blocking Notch function by depleting Rbpj restored normal neurogenesis. Experimental expansion of the apical domain, through inhibition of Shroom3, also increased Notch activity and reduced neurogenesis. Significantly, in wild-type retina, neurogenic retinal progenitors had smaller apical domains compared with proliferative neuroepithelia. As nuclear position during interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM) has been previously linked with cell cycle exit, we analyzed this phenomenon in cells depleted of Llgl1. We found that although IKNM was normal, the relationship between nuclear position and neurogenesis was shifted away from the apical surface, consistent with increased proproliferative and/or anti-neurogenic signals associated with the apical domain. These data, in conjunction with other findings, suggest that, in retinal neuroepithelia, the size of the apical domain modulates the strength of polarized signals that influence neurogenesis.},

  abstract = {The mature vertebrate retina is a highly ordered neuronal network of cell bodies and synaptic neuropils arranged in distinct layers. Little, however, is known about the emergence of this spatial arrangement. Here, we investigate how the three main types of retinal inhibitory neuron (RIN) \textendash{} horizontal cells (HCs), inner nuclear layer amacrine cells (iACs) and displaced amacrine cells (dACs) \textendash{} reach their specific laminar positions during development. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of zebrafish retinas, we show that RINs undergo distinct phases of migration. The first phase, common to all RINs, is bipolar migration directed towards the apicobasal centre of the retina. All RINs then transition to a less directionally persistent multipolar phase of migration. Finally, HCs, iACs and dACs each undergo cell typespecific migration. In contrast to current hypotheses, we find that most dACs send processes into the forming inner plexiform layer (IPL) before migrating through it and inverting their polarity. By imaging and quantifying the dynamics of HCs, iACs and dACs from birth to final position, this study thus provides evidence for distinct and new migration patterns during retinal lamination and insights into the initiation of IPL formation.},

Perpendicular divisions are more likely to be asymmetric and generate one progenitor and one neuronal precursor. Whether the orientation of the mitotic spindle actually determines their asymmetric outcome is unclear. Here, we characterize a mammalian homolog of Inscuteable (mInsc), a key regulator of spindle orientation in Drosophila. mInsc is expressed temporally and spatially in a manner that suggests a role in orienting the mitotic spindle in the developing nervous system. Using retroviral RNAi in rat retinal explants, we show that downregulation of mInsc inhibits vertical divisions. This results in enhanced proliferation, consistent with a higher frequency of symmetric divisions generating two proliferating cells. Our results suggest that the orientation of neural progenitor divisions is important for cell fate specification in the retina and determines their symmetric or asymmetric outcome.},

  abstract = {Several eye-field transcription factors (EFTFs) are expressed in the anterior region of the vertebrate neural plate and are essential for eye formation. The Xenopus EFTFs ET, Rx1, Pax6, Six3, Lhx2, tll and Optx2 are expressed in a dynamic, overlapping pattern in the presumptive eye field. Expression of an EFTF cocktail with Otx2 is sufficient to induce ectopic eyes outside the nervous system at high frequency. Using both cocktail subsets and functional (inductive) analysis of individual EFTFs, we have revealed a genetic network regulating vertebrate eye field specification. Our results support a model of progressive tissue specification in which neural induction then Otx2-driven neural patterning primes the anterior neural plate for eye field formation. Next, the EFTFs form a self-regulating feedback network that specifies the vertebrate eye field. We find striking similarities and differences to the network of homologous Drosophila genes that specify the eye imaginal disc, a finding that is consistent with the idea of a partial evolutionary conservation of eye formation.},

Here, we show that REST regulates the transitions from pluripotent to neural stem/progenitor cell and from progenitor to mature neuron. In the transition to progenitor cell, REST is degraded to levels just sufficient to maintain neuronal gene chromatin in an inactive state that is nonetheless poised for expression. As progenitors differentiate into neurons, REST and its corepressors dissociate from the RE1 site, triggering activation of neuronal genes. In some genes, the level of expression is adjusted further in neurons by CoREST/MeCP2 repressor complexes that remain bound to a site of methylated DNA distinct from the RE1 site. Expression profiling based on this mechanism indicates that REST defines a gene set subject to plasticity in mature neurons. Thus, a multistage repressor mechanism controls the orderly expression of genes during development while still permitting fine tuning in response to specific stimuli.},

When combined with the accessibility and optical clarity of fish embryos, these approaches have made of them an unbeatable model to monitor developmental processes in vivo and in real time. Over the last few years, live-imaging studies in fish have provided fascinating insights into tissue morphogenesis and organogenesis.

Neuroepithelial organization is first apparent at the margin of the eye field, whereas cells at its core have mesenchymal morphology. These core cells subsequently intercalate between the marginal cells contributing to the bilateral expansion of the optic vesicles. During later evagination, optic vesicle cells shorten, drawing their apical surfaces laterally relative to the basal lamina, resulting in further laterally directed evagination. The early neuroepithelial organization of the eye field requires Laminin1, and ectopic Laminin1 can redirect the apicobasal orientation of eye field cells. Furthermore, disrupting cell polarity through combined abrogation of the polarity protein Pard6gb and Laminin1 severely compromises optic vesicle evagination. Our studies elucidate the cellular events underlying early eye morphogenesis and provide a framework for understanding epithelialization and complex tissue formation.},

Wnt/NL-catenin signaling antagonizes eye specification through the activity of Wnt8b and Fz8a. In contrast, Wnt11 and Fz5 promote eye field development, at least in part, through local antagonism of Wnt/NL-catenin signaling. Additionally, Wnt11 regulates the behavior of eye field cells, promoting their cohesion. Together, these results allow us to postulate a model in which Wnt11 and Fz5 signaling promotes early eye development through the coordinated antagonism of signals that suppress retinal identity and promotion of coherence of eye field cells.},

Activating the FGF pathway before gastrulation represses cellular movements in the presumptive anterior neural plate and prevents cells from expressing a retinal fate, independent of mesoderm induction or anterior-posterior patterning. Inhibiting the FGF pathway promotes cell dispersal and significantly increases eye field contribution. ephrinB1 reverse signaling is required to promote cellular movements into the eye field, and can rescue the FGF receptor-induced repression of retinal fate. These results indicate that FGF modulation of ephrin signaling regulates the positioning of retinal progenitor cells within the definitive eye field.},

  abstract = {In the developing vertebrate retina, precise coordination of retinal progenitor cell proliferation and cell-cycle exit is essential for the formation of a functionally mature retina. Unregulated or disrupted cell proliferation may lead to dysplasia, retinal degeneration or retinoblastoma. Both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors regulate the proliferation of progenitor cells during CNS development. There is now growing evidence that in the developing vertebrate retina, both slow and fast neurotransmitter systems modulate the proliferation of retinal progenitor cells. Classic neurotransmitters, such as GABA ({$\gamma$}-amino butyric acid), glycine, glutamate, ACh (acetylcholine) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) are released, via vesicular or non-vesicular mechanisms, into the immature retinal environment. Furthermore, these neurotransmitters signal through functional receptors even before synapses are formed. Recent evidence indicates that the activation of purinergic and muscarinic receptors may regulate the cell-cycle machinery and consequently the expansion of the retinal progenitor pool. Interestingly, GABA and glutamate appear to have opposing roles, inducing retinal progenitor cell-cycle exit. In this review, we present recent findings that begin to elucidate the roles of neurotransmitters as regulators of progenitor cell proliferation at early stages of retinal development. These studies also raise several new questions, including how these neurotransmitters regulate specific cell-cycle pathways and the mechanisms by which retinal progenitor cells integrate the signals from neurotransmitters and other exogenous factors during vertebrate retina development.},

Ca2+ transients, induced by the neurotransmitter ATP acting on purinergic receptors, both increase proliferation and stimulate DNA synthesis in neural retinal progenitor cells. Here, we show that the RPE regulates proliferation in the underlying neural retina by the release of a soluble factor and identify that factor as ATP. Further, we show that this ATP is released by efflux through gap junction connexin 43 hemichannels, the opening of which is evoked by spontaneous elevations of Ca2+ in trigger cells in the RPE. This release mechanism is localized within the RPE cells to the membranes facing the neural retina, a location ideally positioned to influence neural retinal development. ATP released from RPE hemichannels speeds both cell division and proliferation in the neural retina.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, a scientific model is thought to provide a good scientific explanation to the extent that it satisfies certain scientific goals that are thought to be constitutive of explanation (e.g. generating understanding, identifying mechanisms, making predictions, identifying high-level patterns, allowing us to control and manipulate phenomena). Problems arise when we realize that individual scientific models cannot simultaneously satisfy all the scientific goals typically associated with explanation. A given model's ability to satisfy some goals must always come at the expense of satisfying others. This has resulted in philosophical disputes regarding which of these goals are in fact necessary for explanation, and as such which types of models can and cannot provide explanations (e.g. dynamical models, optimality models, topological models, etc.). Explanatory monists argue that one goal will be explanatory in all contexts, while explanatory pluralists argue that the goal will vary based on pragmatic considerations. In this paper, I argue that such debates are misguided, and that both monists and pluralists are incorrect. Instead of any goal being given explanatory priority over others in a given context, the different goals are all deeply dependent on one another for their explanatory power. Any model that sacrifices some explanatory goals to attain others will always necessarily undermine its own explanatory power in the process. And so when forced to choose between individual scientific models, there can be no explanatory victors. Given that no model can satisfy all the goals typically associated with explanation, no one model in isolation can provide a good scientific explanation. Instead we must appeal to collections of models. Collections of models provide an explanation when they satisfy the web of interconnected goals that justify the explanatory power of one another.},

Regulatory genes encode transcription factors and signal molecules, and their expression is under the control of cis-regulatory modules that define the logic of transcriptional responses to the inputs of other regulatory genes. The functional linkages amongst regulatory genes constitute the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern cell specification and patterning in development. Constructing such networks requires identification of the regulatory genes involved and characterization of their temporal and spatial expression patterns. Interactions (activation/ repression) among transcription factors or signals can be investigated by large-scale perturbation analysis, in which the function of each gene is specifically blocked. Resultant expression changes are then integrated to identify direct linkages, and to reveal the structure of the GRN. Predicted GRN linkages can be tested and verified by cis-regulatory analysis. The explanatory power of the GRN was shown in the lineage specification of sea urchin endomesoderm. Acquiring such networks is essential for a systematic and mechanistic understanding of the developmental process.},

No CHX10 protein was detectable in the retinal neuroepithelium of orJ homozygotes. The loss of CHX10 leads both to reduced proliferation of retinal progenitors and to a specific absence of differentiated bipolar cells. Other major retinal cell types were present and correctly positioned in the mutant retina, although rod outer segments were short and retinal lamination was incomplete. These results indicate that Chx10 is an essential component in the network of genes required for the development of the mammalian eye, with profound effects on retinal progenitor proliferation and bipolar cell specification or differentiation. off},

  abstract = {In the developing vertebrate retina, progenitor cells initially proliferate but begin to produce postmitotic neurons when neuronal differentiation occurs. However, the mechanism that determines whether retinal progenitor cells continue to proliferate or exit from the cell cycle and differentiate is largely unknown. Here, we report that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) is required for the switch from proliferation to differentiation in the zebrafish retina. We isolated a zebrafish mutant, ascending and descending (add), in which retinal cells fail to differentiate into neurons and glial cells but instead continue to proliferate. The cloning of the add gene revealed that it encodes Hdac1. Furthermore, the ratio of the number of differentiating cells to that of proliferating cells increases in proportion to Hdac activity, suggesting that Hdac proteins regulate a crucial step of retinal neurogenesis in zebrafish. Canonical Wnt signaling promotes the proliferation of retinal cells in zebrafish, and Notch signaling inhibits neuronal differentiation through the activation of a neurogenic inhibitor, Hairy/Enhancer-of-split (Hes). We found that both the Wnt and Notch/Hes pathways are activated in the add mutant retina. The cell-cycle progression and the upregulation of Hes expression in the add mutant retina can be inhibited by the blockade of Wnt and Notch signaling, respectively. These data suggest that Hdac1 antagonizes these pathways to promote cell-cycle exit and the subsequent neurogenesis in zebrafish retina. Taken together, these data suggest that Hdac1 functions as a dual switch that suppresses both cell-cycle progression and inhibition of neurogenesis in the zebrafish retina.},

The formation and maintenance of neural-competent precursors are regulated by SoxB1 transcription factors, and evidence that their expression is regionally regulated suggests that specific signals regulate neural potential in subdomains of the developing nervous system. We show that the frizzled (Fz) transmembrane receptor Xfz5 selectively governs neural potential in the developing Xenopus retina by regulating the expression of Sox2. Blocking either Xfz5 or canonical Wnt signaling within the developing retina inhibits Sox2 expression, reduces cell proliferation, inhibits the onset of proneural gene expression, and biases individual progenitors toward a nonneural fate, without altering the expression of multiple progenitor markers. Blocking Sox2 function mimics these effects. Rescue experiments indicate that Sox2 is downstream of Xfz5. Thus, Fz signaling can regulate the neural potential of progenitors in the developing nervous system.},

In the vertebrate eye, progenitor cells located in the marginalmost region of the neural retina continue to proliferate for a much longer period compared to the ones in the central retina, thus showing stem-cell-like properties. Wnt2b is expressed in the anterior rim of the optic vesicles, and has been shown to control differentiation of the progenitor cells in the marginal retina. In this paper, we show that stable overexpression of Wnt2b in retinal explants inhibited cellular differentiation and induced continuous growth of the tissue. Notably, Wnt2b maintained the undifferentiated progenitor cells in the explants even under the conditions where Notch signaling was blocked. Wnt2b downregulated the expression of multiple proneural bHLH genes as well as Notch. In addition, expression of Cath5 under the control of an exogenous promoter suppressed the negative effect of Wnt2b on neuronal differentiation. Importantly, Wnt2b inhibited neuronal differentiation independently of cell cycle progression. We propose that Wnt2b maintains the naive state of marginal progenitor cells by attenuating the expression of both proneural and neurogenic genes, thus preventing those cells from launching out into the differentiation cascade regulated by proneural genes and Notch.},

  shorttitle = {Eye Evolution at High Resolution},
  abstract = {Based on differences in morphology, photoreceptor-type usage and lens composition it has been proposed that complex eyes have evolved independently many times. The remarkable observation that different eye types rely on a conserved network of genes (including Pax6/eyeless) for their formation has led to the revised proposal that disparate complex eye types have evolved from a shared and simpler prototype. Did this ancestral eye already contain the neural circuitry required for image processing? And what were the evolutionary events that led to the formation of complex visual systems, such as those found in vertebrates and insects? The recent identification of unexpected cell-type homologies between neurons in the vertebrate and Drosophila visual systems has led to two proposed models for the evolution of complex visual systems from a simple prototype. The first, as an extension of the finding that the neurons of the vertebrate retina share homologies with both insect (rhabdomeric) and vertebrate (ciliary) photoreceptor cell types, suggests that the vertebrate retina is a composite structure, made up of neurons that have evolved from two spatially separate ancestral photoreceptor populations. The second model, based largely on the conserved role for the Vsx homeobox genes in photoreceptor-target neuron development, suggests that the last common ancestor of vertebrates and flies already possessed a relatively sophisticated visual system that contained a mixture of rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptors as well as their first- and second-order target neurons. The vertebrate retina and fly visual system would have subsequently evolved by elaborating on this ancestral neural circuit. Here we present evidence for these two cell-type homologybased models and discuss their implications.},

Using in vivo time-lapse imaging methods, we discovered that in the laminated zebrafish retina, the horizontal cell (HC) layer forms quickly during embryonic development upon division of a precursor cell population. The precursor cells morphologically resemble immature, postmitotic HCs and express HC markers such as ptf1a and Prox1 prior to division. These precursors undergo nonapical symmetric division at the laminar location where mature HCs contact photoreceptors. Strikingly, the precursor cell type we observed generates exclusively HCs. We have thus identified a dedicated HC precursor, and our findings suggest a mechanism of neuronal layer formation whereby the location of mitosis could facilitate rapid contact between synaptic partners.},

  abstract = {During central nervous system development the timing of progenitor differentiation must be precisely controlled to generate the proper number and complement of neuronal cell types. Proneural basic helix\textendash{}loop\textendash{}helix (bHLH) transcription factors play a central role in regulating neurogenesis, and thus the timing of their expression must be regulated to ensure that they act at the appropriate developmental time. In the developing retina, the expression of the bHLH factor Ath5 is controlled by multiple signals in early retinal progenitors, although less is known about how these signals are coordinated to ensure correct spatial and temporal pattern of gene expression. Here we identify a key distal Xath5 enhancer and show that this enhancer regulates the early phase of Xath5 expression, while the proximal enhancer we previously identified acts later. The distal enhancer responds to Pax6, a key patterning factor in the optic vesicle, while FGF signaling regulates Xath5 expression through sequences outside of this region. In addition, we have identified an inhibitory element adjacent to the conserved distal enhancer region that is required to prevent premature initiation of expression in the retina. This temporal regulation of Xath5 gene expression is comparable to proneural gene regulation in Drosophila, whereby separate enhancers regulate different temporal phases of expression.},

Upon Pax6 inactivation, the potential of RPCs becomes entirely restricted to only one of the cell fates normally available to RPCs, resulting in the exclusive generation of amacrine interneurons. Our findings demonstrate furthermore that Pax6 directly controls the transcriptional activation of retinogenic bHLH factors that bias subsets of RPCs toward the different retinal cell fates, thereby mediating the full retinogenic potential of RPCs.},

  abstract = {Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for eye development in vertebrates; known roles in the zebrafish include regulation of eye morphogenesis and ganglion cell and photoreceptor differentiation. We employed a temporally selective Hh signaling knockdown strategy, by using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides or the teratogenic alkaloid cyclopamine, in order to dissect the separate roles of Hh signaling arising from specific sources. We also examined the eye phenotype of zebrafish slow muscle-omitted (smu) mutants, which lack a functional smoothened gene, encoding a component of the Hh signal transduction pathway. We find that Hh signaling from extraretinal sources is required for the initiation of retinal differentiation, but this involvement may be independent of the effects of Hh signaling on optic stalk development. We also find that Hh signals from ganglion cells participate in propagating expression of ath5, and we suggest that the effects of Hh signals from the retinal pigmented epithelium on photoreceptor differentiation may be mediated by the transcription factor rx1.},

In such mixed-age cultures, dividing neonatal cells proliferate much less and give rise to rods much sooner than do dividing embryonic cells, suggesting that the dividing cells at the two ages are intrinsically different.

Delta, a ligand of the Notch receptor, is a candidate for regulating progenitor competence on the grounds that activation of the pathway involving Notch and Delta can inhibit cellular differentiation. Here we test this possibility in the developing Xenopus retina by misexpression of Delta messenger RNA. We find that Delta-misexpressing cells with wild-type neighbours adopt earlier fates, primarily becoming ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors. Progenitors transfected with Delta later in development also produce rod photoreceptors, but not the latest-generated cell types, demonstrating the importance of timing in Delta function. We conclude that Delta signalling in the vertebrate retina is a basic regulatory mechanism that can be used to generate neuronal diversity.},

Using this model we study a complete structure of two-dimensional topographic maps in mutant mice, in which the label encoding the horizontal retinal coordinate ephrin-A is reduced/eliminated. We show that topographic maps in ephrin-A deficient mice display a granular structure, with the regions of smooth mapping separated by linear discontinuities reminiscent of fractures observed in the maps of preferred orientation.},

Results: To investigate the role of HDACs in the developing mammalian retina, a general inhibitor of HDACs, trichostatin-A (TSA), was used to treat newborn murine retinae in explant cultures. Inhibition of HDAC activity resulted in a reduction in RNA levels for genes that regulate retinal development, as well as cell cycle regulators. Several of the genes encode transcription factors essential for rod photoreceptor development, Otx2, Nrl, and Crx. Using luciferase reporter assays, the promoter activity of both Nrl and Crx was found to be compromised by HDAC inhibition. Furthermore, downregulation of gene expression by HDAC inhibition didn't require de novo protein synthesis, and was associated with hyperacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins. Finally, HDAC inhibition in retinal explant cultures resulted in increased cell death, reduction in proliferation, a complete loss of rod photoreceptors and M{\"u}ller glial cells, and an increase in bipolar cells.
Conclusion: HDAC activity is required for the expression of critical pro-rod transcription factors and the development of rod photoreceptor cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into retinal lineages offers great potential for medical application. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to know the key intrinsic regulators of differentiation and the specific biomarker signatures of cell lineages.
Methods: In this study, we used microarrays to analyze transcriptomes of terminally differentiated retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lineages, as well as intermediate retinal progenitor cells of optic vesicles (OVs) derived from hiPSCs. In our analysis, we specifically focused on the classes of transcripts that encode intrinsic regulators of gene expression: the transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic chromatin state regulators. We applied two criteria for the selection of potentially important regulators and markers: firstly, the magnitude of fold-change of upregulation; secondly, the contrasted pattern of differential expression between OV, RGC and RPE lineages.
Results: We found that among the most highly overexpressed TF-encoding genes in the OV/RGC lineage were three members of the Collier/Olfactory-1/Early B-cell family: EBF1, EBF2 and EBF3. Knockdown of EBF1 led to significant impairment of differentiation of hiPSCs into RGCs. EBF1 was shown to act upstream of ISL1 and BRN3A, the well-characterized regulators of RGC lineage specification. TF-encoding genes DLX1, DLX2 and INSM1 were the most highly overexpressed genes in the OVs, indicating their important role in the early stages of retinal differentiation. Along with MITF, the two paralogs, BHLHE41 and BHLHE40, were the most robust TF markers of RPE cells. The markedly contrasted expression of ACTL6B, encoding the component of chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, discriminated hiPSC-derived OV/RGC and RPE lineages.
Conclusions: We identified novel, potentially important intrinsic regulators of RGC and RPE cell lineage specification in the process of differentiation from hiPSCs. We demonstrated the crucial role played by EBF1 in differentiation of RGCs. We identified intrinsic regulator biomarker signatures of these two retinal cell types that can be applied with high confidence to confirm the cell lineage identities.},

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

Global chromatin changes accompany the transition from proliferating NSCs to committed neuronal lineages, but the mechanisms involved have been unclear. Using a proteomics approach, we show that a switch in subunit composition of neural, ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes accompanies this developmental transition. Proliferating neural stem and progenitor cells express complexes in which BAF45a, a Kru\textasciidieresis{} ppel/PHD domain protein and the actinrelated protein BAF53a are quantitatively associated with the SWI2/SNF2-like ATPases, Brg and Brm. As neural progenitors exit the cell cycle, these subunits are replaced by the homologous BAF45b, BAF45c, and BAF53b. BAF45a/53a subunits are necessary and sufficient for neural progenitor proliferation. Preventing the subunit switch impairs neuronal differentiation, indicating that this molecular event is essential for the transition from neural stem/progenitors to postmitotic neurons. More broadly, these studies suggest that SWI/SNF-like complexes in vertebrates achieve biological specificity by combinatorial assembly of their subunits.},

  abstract = {Background: Regeneration is an important biological process for the restoration of organ mass, structure, and function after damage, and involves complex bio-physiological mechanisms including cell differentiation and immune responses. We constructed four regenerative protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using dynamic models and AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), based on time-course microarray data from the regeneration of four zebrafish organs: heart, cerebellum, fin, and retina. We extracted core and organ-specific proteins, and proposed a recalled-blastemalike formation model to uncover regeneration strategies in zebrafish.
Results: It was observed that the core proteins were involved in TGF-{$\beta$} signaling for each step in the recalled-blastema-like formation model and TGF-{$\beta$} signaling may be vital for regeneration. Integrins, FGF, and PDGF accelerate hemostasis during heart injury, while Bdnf shields retinal neurons from secondary damage and augments survival during the injury response. Wnt signaling mediates the growth and differentiation of cerebellum and fin neural stem cells, potentially providing a signal to trigger differentiation.
Conclusion: Through our analysis of all four zebrafish regenerative PPI networks, we provide insights that uncover the underlying strategies of zebrafish organ regeneration.},

  abstract = {The retina of lower vertebrates grows continuously by integrating new neurons generated from progenitors in the ciliary margin zone (CMZ). Whether the mammalian CMZ provides the neural retina with retinal cells is controversial. Live imaging of embryonic retina expressing eGFP in the CMZ shows that cells migrate laterally from the CMZ to the neural retina where differentiated retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) reside. Because Cyclin D2, a cell-cycle regulator, is enriched in ventral CMZ, we analyzed Cyclin D2{\`A}/{\`A} mice to test whether the CMZ is a source of retinal cells. Neurogenesis is diminished in Cyclin D2 mutants, leading to a reduction of RGCs in the ventral retina. In line with these findings, in the albino retina, the decreased production of ipsilateral RGCs is correlated with fewer Cyclin D2+ cells. Together, these results implicate the mammalian CMZ as a neurogenic site that produces RGCs and whose proper generation depends on Cyclin D2 activity.},

  abstract = {In lower vertebrates, stem/progenitor cells located in a peripheral domain of the retina, called the ciliary margin zone (CMZ), cooperate with retinal domain progenitors to build the mature neural retina. In mammals, it is believed that the CMZ lacks neurogenic potential and that the retina develops from one pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). Here we identify a population of Msx1-expressing progenitors in the mouse CMZ that is both molecularly and functionally distinct from RPCs. Using genetic lineage tracing, we report that Msx1 progenitors have unique developmental properties compared with RPCs. Msx1 lineages contain both neural retina and non-neural ciliary epithelial progenies and overall generate fewer photoreceptors than classical RPC lineages. Furthermore, we show that the endocytic adaptor protein Numb regulates the balance between neural and non-neural fates in Msx1 progenitors. These results uncover a population of CMZ progenitors, distinct from classical RPCs, that also contributes to mammalian retinogenesis.},

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {The precise regulation of numbers and types of neurons through control of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation is an essential aspect of neurogenesis. The Hippo signaling pathway has recently been identified as playing a crucial role in promoting cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation in multiple types of stem cells, including in retinal progenitor cells. When Hippo signaling is activated, the core Mst1/2 kinases activate the Lats1/2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the transcriptional cofactor Yap. During mouse retinogenesis, overexpression of Yap prolongs progenitor cell proliferation, whereas inhibition of Yap decreases this proliferation and promotes retinal cell differentiation. However, to date, it remains unknown how the Hippo pathway affects the differentiation of distinct neuronal cell types such as photoreceptor cells. In this study, we investigated whether Hippo signaling regulates retinogenesis during early zebrafish development. Knockdown of zebrafish mst2 induced early embryonic defects, including altered retinal pigmentation and morphogenesis. Similar abnormal retinal phenotypes were observed in zebrafish embryos injected with a constitutively active form of yap [(yap (5SA)]. Loss of Yap's TEAD-binding domain, two WW domains, or transcription activation domain attenuated the retinal abnormalities induced by yap (5SA), indicating that all of these domains contribute to normal retinal development. Remarkably, yap (5SA)-expressing zebrafish embryos displayed decreased expression of transcription factors such as otx5 and crx, which orchestrate photoreceptor cell differentiation by activating the expression of rhodopsin and other photoreceptor cell genes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Rx1 is a novel interacting partner of Yap that regulates photoreceptor cell differentiation. Our results suggest that Yap suppresses the differentiation of photoreceptor cells from retinal progenitor cells by repressing Rx1-mediated transactivation of photoreceptor cell genes during zebrafish retinogenesis.},

  issn = {0027-8424, 1091-6490},
  abstract = {We analyzed the differentiation of murine hemopoietic colonies derived from paired progenitors in culture. Single progenitors were isolated by use of a micromanipulation technique from blast cell colonies cultured from the spleens of 5-fluorouracil-treated mice. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the paired progenitors were separated with a micromanipulator and cultured in methylcellulose medium containing erythropoietin and pokeweed-mitogen spleen cell conditioned medium. Six to nine days later, the two colonies derived from the paired progenitors were individually picked and differential counts were performed by using May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. The abbreviations used here are n, neutrophil; m, macrophage; e, eosinophil; mast, mast cell; M, megakaryocyte; E, erythrocyte. Of a total of 387 pairs that could be evaluated, 68 were pairs of colonies consisting of dissimilar combinations of cell lineages such as m-nmmastEM, M-nmmastEM, nmnmmastEM, nmmastM-nmmastEM, M-nmmastM, nmmastnmmastM, nm-nmniastE, M-nmM, n-nmM, mM-nmM, mnmmast, nm-nine, me-nmn mM-nm, n-ne, m-mmast, in-mM, M-nm, M-mM, E-nm, in-nmn, M-m, etc. Thirty-nine were homologous pairs revealing identical lineage combinations such as nmmastEM, nmmastM, nmmast, mmastEM, nmEM, nine, nmM, mM, and nm lineages. However, in members of some of these pairs, the proportions of the individual cell lineages were significantly different. the remainder were pairs of single lineage colonies. Paired progenitors obtained from the stem cell colonies of normal mice also revealed homologous and nonhomologous expression of the cell lineages. Comparison of lineage expression in colonies derived from single progenitors with the sum of lineages expressed in pairs of colonies derived from single progenitors indicated that the diversity was not due to injury inflicted by micromanipulation. These observations provide experimental data in support of stochastic mechanisms of stem cell differentiation.},

We focus on recent findings that suggest that operational taxonomic unit-based analyses should be replaced with new methods that are based on exact sequence variants, methods for integrating metagenomic and metabolomic data, and issues surrounding compositional data analysis, where advances have been particularly rapid. We note that although some of these approaches are new{$\mkern1mu$}, it is important to keep sight of the classic issues that arise during experimental design and relate to research reproducibility. We describe how keeping these issues in mind allows researchers to obtain more insight from their microbiome data sets.},

  abstract = {Dynamic system consisting of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a well-known tool for describing dynamic nature of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and the dynamic features of GRNs are usually captured through time-course gene expression data. Owing to high-throughput technologies, time-course gene expression data have complex structures such as heteroscedasticity, correlations between genes, and time dependence. Since gene experiments typically yield highly noisy data with small sample size, for a more accurate prediction of the dynamics, the complex structures should be taken into account in ODE models. Hence, this study proposes an ODE model considering such data structures and a fast and stable estimation method for the ODE parameters based on the generalized profiling approach with data smoothing techniques. The proposed method also provides statistical inference for the ODE estimator and it is applied to a zebrafish retina cell network.},

  abstract = {Recent microscopic and simulation studies have shown that the genome structure fluctuates dynamically in the nuclei of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This genome-wide movement should lead to the fluctuations of individual genes in their territorial regions. This raises an intriguing question of whether the resulting distribution of genes is correlated to their transcriptional activity. An effective method for examining this correlation is to analyze how the spatial distribution of genes and their transcriptional activity are modified by mutation. In this study, we analyzed the modification observed in a budding yeast mutant in which genes necessary for anchoring telomeres to the nuclear envelope, yku70 and esc1, are silenced. Taddei et al. reported that 60 genes are clearly misregulated by this mutation, with 28 and 32 genes downregulated and upregulated, respectively. We calculated the probability density maps of the misregulated genes using a model of dynamical movement of the yeast genome in both wild-type (WT) and yku70 esc1 mutant and showed that the density of downregulated genes is larger near the nucleolus, whereas the density of upregulated genes is larger at the opposite side of the nucleus. By comparing these genes with those highly (top 200 of transcriptome) and lowly (bottom 200) expressed, we showed that the simulated distribution of 28 downregulated (12 out of 32 upregulated) genes has a distinctly larger overlap with the distribution of lowly (highly) expressed genes in the mutant than in the WT. The remaining 20 upregulated genes are localized near the nuclear envelope both in the WT and in the mutant. These results showed that the transcriptional level of genes is affected by their spatial distribution, thus highlighting the importance of the structural regulation in the yeast genome.},

  abstract = {The comparison of spatial patterns is a fundamental task in geography and quantitative spatial modelling. With the growth of data being collected with a geospatial element, we are witnessing an increased interest in analyses requiring spatial pattern comparisons (e.g., model assessment and change analysis). In this paper, we review quantitative techniques for comparing spatial patterns, examining key methodological approaches developed both within and beyond the field of geography. We highlight the key challenges using examples from widely known datasets from the spatial analysis literature. Through these examples, we identify a problematic dichotomy between spatial pattern and process\textemdash{}a widespread issue in the age of big geospatial data. Further, we identify the role of complex topology, the interdependence of spatial configuration and composition, and spatial scale as key (research) challenges. Several areas ripe for geographic research are discussed to establish a consolidated research agenda for spatial pattern comparison grounded in quantitative geography. Hierarchical scaling and the modifiable areal unit problem are highlighted as ideas which can be exploited to identify pattern similarities across spatial and temporal scales. Increased use of ``time-aware'' comparisons of spatial processes are suggested, which properly account for spatial evolution and pattern formation. Simulation-based inference is identified as particularly promising for integrating spatial pattern comparison into existing modelling frameworks. To date, the literature on spatial pattern comparison has been fragmented, and we hope this work will provide a basis for others to build on in future studies.},

In this paper, we propose a q-statistic method to measure the degree of spatial stratified heterogeneity and to test its significance. The q value is within [0,1] (0 if a spatial stratification of heterogeneity is not significant, and 1 if there is a perfect spatial stratification of heterogeneity). The exact probability density function is derived.

Using computational simulations we demonstrate that the model is capable of quantitatively describing and predicting the dynamic behaviour of the intestinal tissue during steady state as well as after cell damage and following selective gain or loss of gene function manipulations affecting Wnt- and Notch-signalling. Our simulation results suggest that reversibility and flexibility of cellular decisions are key elements of robust tissue organisation of the intestine. We predict that the tissue should be able to fully recover after complete elimination of cellular subpopulations including subpopulations deemed to be functional stem cells.

  volume = {128},
  issn = {0021-9533, 1477-9137},
  abstract = {Morphogenetic mechanisms such as cell movement or tissue separation depend on cell attachment and detachment processes, which involve adhesion receptors as well as the cortical cytoskeleton. The interplay between the two components is of stunning complexity. Most strikingly, the binding energy of adhesion molecules is usually too small for substantial cell\textendash{}cell attachment, pointing to a main deficit in our present understanding of adhesion. In this Opinion article, I integrate recent findings and conceptual advances in the field into a coherent framework for cell adhesion. I argue that active cortical tension is best viewed as an integral part of adhesion, and propose on this basis a non-arbitrary measure of adhesion strength \textendash{} the tissue surface tension of cell aggregates. This concept of adhesion integrates heterogeneous molecular inputs into a single mechanical property and simplifies the analysis of attachment\textendash{}detachment processes. It draws attention to the enormous variation of adhesion strengths among tissues, whose origin and function is little understood.},

  abstract = {Chromosome alignment at the equator of the mitotic spindle is a highly conserved step during cell division, however, its importance to genomic stability and cellular fitness are not understood. Normal mammalian somatic cells lacking Kif18A function complete cell division without aligning chromosomes. These alignment-deficient cells display normal chromosome copy numbers in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that chromosome alignment is largely dispensable for maintenance of euploidy. However, we find that loss of chromosome alignment leads to interchromosomal compaction defects during anaphase, abnormal organization of chromosomes into a single nucleus at mitotic exit, and the formation of micronuclei in vitro and in vivo. These defects slow cell proliferation and reduce postnatal growth and survival with variable penetrance in mice. Our studies support a model in which the alignment of mitotic chromosomes promotes proper nuclear envelope reassembly and continued proliferation by ensuring that chromosomes segregate as a compact mass during anaphase.},

  issn = {09609822},
  abstract = {Background: Epithelial junctional networks assume packing geometries characterized by different cell shapes, neighbor number distributions and areas. The development of specific packing geometries is tightly controlled; in the Drosophila wing epithelium, cells convert from an irregular to a hexagonal array shortly before hair formation. Packing geometry is determined by developmental mechanisms that likely control the biophysical properties of cells and their interactions.
Results: To understand how physical cellular properties and proliferation determine cell-packing geometries, we use a vertex model for the epithelial junctional network in which cell packing geometries correspond to stable and stationary network configurations. The model takes into account cell elasticity and junctional forces arising from cortical contractility and adhesion. By numerically simulating proliferation, we generate different network morphologies that depend on physical parameters. These networks differ in polygon class distribution, cell area variation, and the rate of T1 and T2 transitions during growth. Comparing theoretical results to observed cell morphologies reveals regions of parameter space where calculated network morphologies match observed ones. We independently estimate parameter values by quantifying network deformations caused by laser ablating individual cell boundaries.
Conclusions: The vertex model accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed packing geometry in the wing disc and its response to perturbation by laser ablation. Epithelial packing geometry is a consequence of both physical cellular properties and the disordering influence of proliferation. The occurrence of T2 transitions during network growth suggests that elimination of cells from the proliferating disc epithelium may be the result of junctional force balances.},

  title = {Stochastic Process},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In probability theory and related fields, a stochastic or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a collection of random variables. Historically, the random variables were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time, such as the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as biology, chemistry, ecology, neuroscience, and physics as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography and telecommunications. Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.Applications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or Brownian motion process, used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time. These two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes, and were discovered repeatedly and independently, both before and after Bachelier and Erlang, in different settings and countries.The term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process, because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space. The terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably, often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables. But often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line. If the random variables are indexed by the Cartesian plane or some higher-dimensional Euclidean space, then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead. The values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects.Based on their properties, stochastic processes can be divided into various categories, which include random walks, martingales, Markov processes, L{\'e}vy processes, Gaussian processes, random fields, renewal processes, and branching processes. The study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability, calculus, linear algebra, set theory, and topology as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis, measure theory, Fourier analysis, and functional analysis. The theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications.},

Using hyperspectral imaging in the field, in vivo 2-photon imaging of retinal neurons, and anatomy, here we show that larval zebrafish use a highly anisotropic retina to asymmetrically survey their natural visual world. First, different neurons dominate different parts of the eye and are linked to a systematic shift in inner retinal function: above the animal, there is little color in nature, and retinal circuits are largely achromatic. Conversely, the lower visual field and horizon are color rich and are predominately surveyed by chromatic and coloropponent circuits that are spectrally matched to the dominant chromatic axes in nature. Second, in the horizontal and lower visual field, bipolar cell terminals encoding achromatic and color-opponent visual features are systematically arranged into distinct layers of the inner retina. Third, above the frontal horizon, a high-gain UV system piggybacks onto retinal circuits, likely to support prey capture.},

  issn = {00121606},
  abstract = {Defects in choroid fissure (CF) formation and closure lead to coloboma, a major cause of childhood blindness. Despite genetic advances, the cellular defects underlying coloboma remain poorly elucidated due to our limited understanding of normal CF morphogenesis. We address this deficit by conducting high-resolution spatiotemporal analyses of CF formation and closure in the chick, mouse and fish. We show that a small ventral midline invagination initiates CF formation in the medial-proximal optic cup, subsequently extending it dorsally toward the lens, and proximally into the optic stalk. Unlike previously supposed, the optic disc does not form solely as a result of this invagination. Morphogenetic events that alter the shape of the proximal optic cup also direct clusters of outer layer and optic stalk cells to form dorsal optic disc. A cross-species comparison suggests that CF closure can be accomplished by breaking down basement membranes (BM) along the CF margins, and by establishing BM continuity along the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the CF. CF closure is subsequently accomplished via two distinct mechanisms: tissue fusion or the intercalation of various tissues into the inter-CF space. We identify several novel cell behaviors that underlie CF fusion, many of which involve remodeling of the retinal epithelium. In addition to BM disruption, these include NCAD downregulation along the SOX2+ retinal CF margin, and the protrusion or movement of partially polarized retinal cells into the inter-CF space to mediate fusion. Proximally, the inter-CF space does not fuse or narrow and is instead loosely packed with migrating SOX2+/PAX2+/Vimentin+ astrocytes until it is closed by the outgoing optic nerve. Taken together, our results highlight distinct proximal-distal differences in CF morphogenesis and closure and establish detailed cellular models that can be utilized for understanding the genetic bases of coloboma.},

In the special case of functional data analysis, these data objects are curves, where standard Euclidean approaches, such as principal component analysis, have been very successful. Recent developments in medical image analysis motivate the statistical analysis of populations of more complex data objects which are elements of mildly non-Euclidean spaces, such as Lie groups and symmetric spaces, or of strongly non-Euclidean spaces, such as spaces of tree-structured data objects. These new contexts for object oriented data analysis create several potentially large new interfaces between mathematics and statistics. This point is illustrated through the careful development of a novel mathematical framework for statistical analysis of populations of tree-structured objects.},

Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cellbased simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to `re-invent the wheel' with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular testdriven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided.

  abstract = {Statistical models are the traditional choice to test scientific theories when observations, processes or boundary conditions are subject to stochasticity. Many important systems in ecology and biology, however, are difficult to capture with statistical models. Stochastic simulation models offer an alternative, but they were hitherto associated with a major disadvantage: their likelihood functions can usually not be calculated explicitly, and thus it is difficult to couple them to well-established statistical theory such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistics. A number of new methods, among them Approximate Bayesian Computing and Pattern-Oriented Modelling, bypass this limitation. These methods share three main principles: aggregation of simulated and observed data via summary statistics, likelihood approximation based on the summary statistics, and efficient sampling. We discuss principles as well as advantages and caveats of these methods, and demonstrate their potential for integrating stochastic simulation models into a unified framework for statistical modelling.},

However, molecular mechanisms underlying this folding, and the way folding affects transcriptional activity, remain obscure. Here we review physical principles driving proteins bound to long polymers into clusters surrounded by loops, and present a parsimonious yet comprehensive model for the way the organization determines function. We argue that clusters of active RNA polymerases and their transcription factors are major architectural features; then, contact domains, TADs and compartments just reflect one or more loops and clusters. We suggest tethering a gene close to a cluster containing appropriate factors\textendash\textendash{}a transcription factory\textendash\textendash{}increases the firing frequency, and offer solutions to many current puzzles concerning the actions of enhancers, superenhancers, boundaries and eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci). As a result, the activity of any gene is directly influenced by the activity of other transcription units around it in 3D space, and this is supported by Brownian-dynamics simulations of transcription factors binding to cognate sites on long polymers.},

Oligodendrocytes developed by a proliferative lineage in which clonal progeny differentiated together after a number of cell divisions. Most O-2A progenitor cells had similar cell cycle times (1-2 days), but their proliferative capacity varied greatly: some divided only once while others divided up to eight times before differentiating. Sister cells behaved similarly when recultured separately on astrocyte monolayers. These findings am consistent with the cell-division-counting hypothesis previously proposed to explain the timing of oligodendrocyte diffetentiation. They also unambiguously establish the phenotype of O-2A progenitor cells in vitro and demonstrate that these cells respond directly to growth factors produced by type-l astrocyte monolayers.},

  abstract = {The potency of post-embryonic stem cells can only be addressed in the living organism, by labeling single cells after embryonic development and following their descendants. Recently, transplantation experiments involving permanently labeled cells revealed multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) of embryonic origin in the medaka retina. To analyze whether NSC potency is affected by developmental progression, as reported for the mammalian brain, we developed an inducible toolkit for clonal labeling and non-invasive fate tracking. We used this toolkit to address post-embryonic stem cells in different tissues and to functionally differentiate transient progenitor cells from permanent, bona fide stem cells in the retina. Using temporally controlled clonal induction, we showed that post-embryonic retinal NSCs are exclusively multipotent and give rise to the complete spectrum of cell types in the neural retina. Intriguingly, and in contrast to any other vertebrate stem cell system described so far, long-term analysis of clones indicates a preferential mode of asymmetric cell division. Moreover, following the behavior of clones before and after external stimuli, such as injuries, shows that NSCs in the retina maintained the preference for asymmetric cell division during regenerative responses. We present a comprehensive analysis of individual post-embryonic NSCs in their physiological environment and establish the teleost retina as an ideal model for studying adult stem cell biology at single cell resolution.},

The simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm has recently attracted considerable attention for challenging optimization problems where it is difficult or impossible to directly obtain a gradient of the objective function with respect to the parameters being optimized. SPSA is based on an easily implemented and highly efficient gradient approximation that relies on measurements of the objective function, not on measurements of the gradient of the objective function. The gradient approximation is based on only two function measurements (regardless of the dimension of the gradient vector). This contrasts with standard finite-difference approaches, which require a number of function measurements proportional to the dimension of the gradient vector. This paper presents a simple step-by-step guide to implementation of SPSA in generic optimization problems and offers some practical suggestions for choosing certain algorithm coefficients.},

  abstract = {A cumulative labelling protocol using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BUdR) was followed to determine: (1) the growth fraction (i.e., the proportion of cells that comprise the proliferating population), (2) the length of the cell cycle, and (3) the length of the DNA-synthetic phase (S-phase) for proliferative cells in the dentate gyrus of the mouse. On postnatal day 20 (P20), C57BL/6J mice were injected with BUdR at two hour intervals for a total period of 12 hours. Animals were sacrificed at selected intervals, and the brains were processed for immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody directed against single-stranded DNA containing BUdR. The numbers of BUdR-labelled and unlabelled cells in sections through the hilus of the dentate gyrus were counted. The number of BUdR-labelled cells increased linearly from an initial value of about 12\% of the total number of cells to a maximum value of just over 24\% of the total. These findings indicate that, at P20, a maximum of 24.2 +/- 1.2\% of the cells in the dentate hilus are part of the proliferating population. The calculated length of the cell cycle of the cells comprising the intrahilar proliferative zone was estimated to be 16.1 +/- 0.8 h. The length of the S-phase was estimated at 8.0 +/- 0.4 h. In addition, mathematical analysis, using one and two population models, indicates that over 90\% of the proliferating cells in the dentate hilus at this age comprise a single population at least in terms of the lengths of the cell cycle and the S-phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Like all postmodernist philosophies, it presents serious difficulties for traditional monotheistic theologies and their basic affirmations about the human subject. Some are apprehensive of the atheistic tendencies of deconstruction, but others have enthusiastically argued for the possibility of a theistic appropriation of postmodem themes and their hermeneutics of suspicion and finitude. This article provides an outline of the ethico-theroretical basis of deconstruction, and examines its ethical claims. Derrida's views on Islam as reflected in his discourse on hospitality are examined, and a critical evaluation of the ethical propositions of deconstruction from an Islamic perspective is presented.},

Zebrafish have become an indispensable complementary model organism in gerontology research, yet their growthcontrol properties significantly differ from those in mammals. Here, we took advantage of the clearly defined and highly conserved structure of the fish retina to study the relationship between the processes of growth and aging in the adult zebrafish central nervous system (CNS). Detailed morphological measurements reveal an early phase of extensive retinal growth, where both the addition of new cells and stretching of existent tissue drive the increase in retinal surface. Thereafter, and coinciding with a significant decline in retinal growth rate, a neurodegenerative phenotype becomes apparent,\textendash{}characterized by a loss of synaptic integrity, an age-related decrease in cell density and the onset of cellular senescence.},

  abstract = {Patterning of a continuously growing naive field in the context of a life-long growing organ such as the teleost eye is of highest functional relevance. Intrinsic and extrinsic signals were proposed to regulate lineage specification in progenitors that exit the stem cell niche in the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). The proper cell type composition arising from those progenitors is prerequisite for retinal function. Our findings in the teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes) uncover that the Notch\textendash{}Atoh7 axis continuously patterns the CMZ. The complement of cell-types originating from the two juxtaposed progenitors marked by Notch or Atoh7 activity contains all constituents of a retinal column. Modulation of Notch signalling specifically in Atoh7-expressing cells demonstrates the crucial role of this axis in generating the correct cell type proportions. After transiently blocking Notch signalling, retinal patterning and differentiation is reinitiated de novo. Taken together we show that Notch activity in the CMZ continuously structures the growing retina by juxtaposing Notch and Atoh7 progenitors giving rise to distinct, complementary lineages, revealing a coupling of de novo patterning and cell-type specification in the respective lineages.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.

We then derive an energy-based CPDF (EBCDPF) in which energy plays a critical role. We argue for the redefinition and measurement of real GDP in terms of exergy. We conclude that the ``Solow Residual'' measures the contribution of exergy to growth, and that the exponents in the EBCDPF should be based on cross-country comparative data as suggested by Mankiw (1995) rather than the ``cost-share theorem''.},

Widely-used software tools for sequence clustering utilize greedy approaches that are not guaranteed to produce the best results. These tools are sensitive to one parameter that determines the similarity among sequences in a cluster. Often times, a biologist may not know the exact sequence similarity. Therefore, clusters produced by these tools do not likely match the real clusters comprising the data if the provided parameter is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the mean shift algorithm, an unsupervised machinelearning algorithm, which has been used successfully thousands of times in fields such as image processing and computer vision. The theory behind the mean shift algorithm, unlike the greedy approaches, guarantees convergence to the modes, e.g. cluster centers. Here we describe the first application of the mean shift algorithm to clustering DNA sequences. MeShClust is one of few applications of the mean shift algorithm in bioinformatics. Further, we applied supervised machine learning to predict the identity score produced by global alignment using alignment-free methods. We demonstrate MeShClust's ability to cluster DNA sequences with high accuracy even when the sequence similarity parameter provided by the user is not very accurate.},

THiCweed clusters bound regions based on sequence similarity using a divisive hierarchical clustering approach based on sequence similarity within sliding windows, while exploring both strands. ThiCweed is specially geared toward data containing mixtures of motifs, which present a challenge to traditional motif-finders. Our implementation is significantly faster than standard motif-finding programs, able to process 30 000 peaks in 1\textendash{}2 h, on a single CPU core of a desktop computer. On synthetic data containing mixtures of motifs it is as accurate or more accurate than all other tested programs. THiCweed performs best with large `window' sizes ({$\geq$}50 bp), much longer than typical binding sites (7\textendash{}15 bp). On real data it successfully recovers literature motifs, but also uncovers complex sequence characteristics in flanking DNA, variant motifs and secondary motifs even when they occur in {$<$}5\% of the input, all of which appear biologically relevant. We also find recurring sequence patterns across diverse ChIP-seq datasets, possibly related to chromatin architecture and looping. THiCweed thus goes beyond traditional motif finding to give new insights into genomic transcription factor-binding complexity.},

  volume = {6},

  abstract = {DNA in eukaryotes is packaged into a chromatin complex, the most basic element of which is the nucleosome. The precise positioning of the nucleosome cores allows for selective access to the DNA, and the mechanisms that control this positioning are important pieces of the gene expression puzzle. We describe a large-scale nucleosome pattern that jointly characterizes the nucleosome core and the adjacent linkers and is predominantly characterized by long-range oscillations in the mono, di- and tri-nucleotide content of the DNA sequence, and we show that this pattern can be used to predict nucleosome positions in both Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae more accurately than previously published methods. Surprisingly, in both H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, the most informative individual features are the mono-nucleotide patterns, although the inclusion of di- and tri-nucleotide features results in improved performance. Our approach combines a much longer pattern than has been previously used to predict nucleosome positioning from sequence\textemdash{}301 base pairs, centered at the position to be scored\textemdash{}with a novel discriminative classification approach that selectively weights the contributions from each of the input features. The resulting scores are relatively insensitive to local AT-content and can be used to accurately discriminate putative dyad positions from adjacent linker regions without requiring an additional dynamic programming step and without the attendant edge effects and assumptions about linker length modeling and overall nucleosome density. Our approach produces the best dyad-linker classification results published to date in H. sapiens, and outperforms two recently published models on a large set of S. cerevisiae nucleosome positions. Our results suggest that in both genomes, a comparable and relatively small fraction of nucleosomes are well-positioned and that these positions are predictable based on sequence alone. We believe that the bulk of the remaining nucleosomes follow a statistical positioning model.},

In order to automate data analysis, we propose to standardize NGS tasks into modular workflows. This simplifies reliable handling and processing of NGS data, and corresponding solutions become substantially more reproducible and easier to maintain. Here, we present a documented, linux-based, toolbox of 42 processing modules that are combined to construct workflows facilitating a variety of tasks such as DNAseq and RNAseq analysis. We also describe important technical extensions. The high throughput executor (HTE) helps to increase the reliability and to reduce manual interventions when processing complex datasets. We also provide a dedicated binary manager that assists users in obtaining the modules' executables and keeping them up to date. As basis for this actively developed toolbox we use the workflow management software KNIME.},

Using clonal analyses (lineage tracing and single cell cultures), we identify rod versus cone lineagespecific progenitors derived from both adult retinal stem cells and embryonic neural retinal precursors. Taurine and retinoic acid are shown to act in an instructive and lineage-restricted manner early in the progenitor lineage hierarchy to produce rod-restricted progenitors from stem cell progeny. We also identify an instructive, but lineage-independent, mechanism for the specification of cone-restricted progenitors through the suppression of multiple differentiation signaling pathways. These data indicate that exogenous signals play critical roles in directing lineage decisions and resulting in fate-restricted rod or cone photoreceptor progenitors in culture. Additional factors may be involved in governing photoreceptor fates in vivo.},

The learned representations outperform existing methods on 3D recognition tasks and enable shape editing via simple algebraic manipulations, such as semantic part editing, shape analogies and shape interpolation, as well as shape completion. We perform a thorough study of different generative models including GANs operating on the raw point clouds, significantly improved GANs trained in the fixed latent space of our AEs, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). To quantitatively evaluate generative models we introduce measures of sample fidelity and diversity based on matchings between sets of point clouds. Interestingly, our evaluation of generalization, fidelity and diversity reveals that GMMs trained in the latent space of our AEs yield the best results overall.},

A good example is Moore's Law. The number of researchers required today to achieve the famous doubling every two years of the density of computer chips is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s. Across a broad range of case studies at various levels of (dis)aggregation, we find that ideas \textemdash{} and in particular the exponential growth they imply \textemdash{} are getting harder and harder to find.

The anodization variables affect the two main processes taking part in the Al2O3 layer formation: alumina generation and its dissolution that are controlled by temperature, electrolyte concentration and time. The proper combination of both processes, as a result of the anodization variables choice, produces adherent alumina layers with tailored porosity and surface morphology that show excellent properties to be used as catalyst structured support. Larger pore sizes and the complete absence of sulfur that may poison reduced metal-supported active phases are main differences with the classical, most often used, sulfuric acid anodization process.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Limiting the duration of antimicrobial treatment constitutes a potential strategy to reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance among children with acute otitis media.
METHODS We assigned 520 children, 6 to 23 months of age, with acute otitis media to receive amoxicillin\textendash{}clavulanate either for a standard duration of 10 days or for a reduced duration of 5 days followed by placebo for 5 days. We measured rates of clinical response (in a systematic fashion, on the basis of signs and symptomatic response), recurrence, and nasopharyngeal colonization, and we analyzed episode outcomes using a noninferiority approach. Symptom scores ranged from 0 to 14, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms.
RESULTS Children who were treated with amoxicillin\textendash{}clavulanate for 5 days were more likely than those who were treated for 10 days to have clinical failure (77 of 229 children [34\%] vs. 39 of 238 [16\%]; difference, 17 percentage points [based on unrounded data]; 95\% confidence interval, 9 to 25). The mean symptom scores over the period from day 6 to day 14 were 1.61 in the 5-day group and 1.34 in the 10-day group (P\,=\,0.07); the mean scores at the day-12-to-14 assessment were 1.89 versus 1.20 (P\,=\,0.001). The percentage of children whose symptom scores decreased more than 50\% (indicating less severe symptoms) from baseline to the end of treatment was lower in the 5-day group than in the 10-day group (181 of 227 children [80\%] vs. 211 of 233 [91\%], P\,=\,0.003). We found no significant between-group differences in rates of recurrence, adverse events, or nasopharyngeal colonization with penicillin-nonsusceptible pathogens. Clinical-failure rates were greater among children who had been exposed to three or more children for 10 or more hours per week than among those with less exposure (P\,=\,0.02) and were also greater among children with infection in both ears than among those with infection in one ear (P{$<$}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS Among children 6 to 23 months of age with acute otitis media, reduced-duration antimicrobial treatment resulted in less favorable outcomes than standard-duration treatment; in addition, neither the rate of adverse events nor the rate of emergence of antimicrobial resistance was lower with the shorter regimen.

  abstract = {DNA sequences that are present in nucleosomes have a preferential \$10 bp periodicity of certain dinuc10 leotide signals (1,2), but the overall sequence similarity of the nucleosomal DNA is weak, and traditional multiple sequence alignment tools fail to yield meaningful alignments. We develop a mixture model that characterizes the known dinucleotide periodicity 15 probabilistically to improve the alignment of nucleosomal DNAs. We assume that a periodic dinucleotide signal of any type emits according to a probability distribution around a series of `hot spots' that are equally spaced along nucleosomal DNA with 10 bp 20 period, but with a 1 bp phase shift across the middle of the nucleosome. We model the three statistically most significant dinucleotide signals, AA/TT, GC and TA, simultaneously, while allowing phase shifts between the signals. The alignment is obtained by 25 maximizing the likelihood of both Watson and Crick strands simultaneously. The resulting alignment of 177 chicken nucleosomal DNA sequences revealed that all 10 distinct dinucleotides are periodic, however, with only two distinct phases and varying 30 intensity. By Fourier analysis, we show that our new alignment has enhanced periodicity and sequence identity compared with center alignment. The significance of the nucleosomal DNA sequence alignment is evaluated by comparing it with that obtained using 35 the same model on non-nucleosomal sequences.},

The algorithm has been subject to a thorough comparison with alternative clustering techniques and we briefly summarize these results. We then present investigations into the mechanisms at the heart of MOCK: we discuss a simple example demonstrating the synergistic effects at work in multiobjective clustering, which explain its superiority to singleobjective clustering techniques, and we analyse how MOCK's Pareto fronts compare to the performance curves obtained by single-objective algorithms run with a range of different numbers of clusters specified.},

  title = {Non-Targeted Transcription Factors Motifs Are a Systemic Component of {{ChIP}}-Seq Datasets},
  abstract = {Background: The global effort to annotate the non-coding portion of the human genome relies heavily on chromatin immunoprecipitation data generated with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq). ChIP-seq is generally successful in detailing the segments of the genome bound by the immunoprecipitated transcription factor (TF), however almost all datasets contain genomic regions devoid of the canonical motif for the TF. It remains to be determined if these regions are related to the immunoprecipitated TF or whether, despite the use of controls, there is a portion of peaks that can be attributed to other causes.
Results: Analyses across hundreds of ChIP-seq datasets generated for sequence-specific DNA binding TFs reveal a small set of TF binding profiles for which predicted TF binding site motifs are repeatedly observed to be significantly enriched. Grouping related binding profiles, the set includes: CTCF-like, ETS-like, JUN-like, and THAP11 profiles. These frequently enriched profiles are termed `zingers' to highlight their unanticipated enrichment in datasets for which they were not the targeted TF, and their potential impact on the interpretation and analysis of TF ChIP-seq data. Peaks with zinger motifs and lacking the ChIPped TF's motif are observed to compose up to 45\% of a ChIP-seq dataset. There is substantial overlap of zinger motif containing regions between diverse TF datasets, suggesting a mechanism that is not TF-specific for the recovery of these regions.
Conclusions: Based on the zinger regions proximity to cohesin-bound segments, a loading station model is proposed. Further study of zingers will advance understanding of gene regulation.},

  volume = {19},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  shorttitle = {Shrinkage {{Clustering}}},
  abstract = {Background
Many common clustering algorithms require a two-step process that limits their efficiency. The algorithms need to be performed repetitively and need to be implemented together with a model selection criterion. These two steps are needed in order to determine both the number of clusters present in the data and the corresponding cluster memberships. As biomedical datasets increase in size and prevalence, there is a growing need for new methods that are more convenient to implement and are more computationally efficient. In addition, it is often essential to obtain clusters of sufficient sample size to make the clustering result meaningful and interpretable for subsequent analysis.

Results
We introduce Shrinkage Clustering, a novel clustering algorithm based on matrix factorization that simultaneously finds the optimal number of clusters while partitioning the data. We report its performances across multiple simulated and actual datasets, and demonstrate its strength in accuracy and speed applied to subtyping cancer and brain tissues. In addition, the algorithm offers a straightforward solution to clustering with cluster size constraints.

Conclusions
Given its ease of implementation, computing efficiency and extensible structure, Shrinkage Clustering can be applied broadly to solve biomedical clustering tasks especially when dealing with large datasets.},

  volume = {7},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {A major challenge in molecular biology is reverse-engineering the cis-regulatory logic that plays a major role in the control of gene expression. This program includes searching through DNA sequences to identify ``motifs'' that serve as the binding sites for transcription factors or, more generally, are predictive of gene expression across cellular conditions. Several approaches have been proposed for de novo motif discovery\textendash{}searching sequences without prior knowledge of binding sites or nucleotide patterns. However, unbiased validation is not straightforward. We consider two approaches to unbiased validation of discovered motifs: testing the statistical significance of a motif using a DNA ``background'' sequence model to represent the null hypothesis and measuring performance in predicting membership in gene clusters. We demonstrate that the background models typically used are ``too null,'' resulting in overly optimistic assessments of significance, and argue that performance in predicting TF binding or expression patterns from DNA motifs should be assessed by held-out data, as in predictive learning. Applying this criterion to common motif discovery methods resulted in universally poor performance, although there is a marked improvement when motifs are statistically significant against real background sequences. Moreover, on synthetic data where ``ground truth'' is known, discriminative performance of all algorithms is far below the theoretical upper bound, with pronounced ``over-fitting'' in training. A key conclusion from this work is that the failure of de novo discovery approaches to accurately identify motifs is basically due to statistical intractability resulting from the fixed size of co-regulated gene clusters, and thus such failures do not necessarily provide evidence that unfound motifs are not active biologically. Consequently, the use of prior knowledge to enhance motif discovery is not just advantageous but necessary.

  abstract = {The replication-dependent histone mRNAs in metazoa are not polyadenylated, in contrast to the bulk of mRNA. Instead, they contain an RNA stem\textendash{}loop (SL) structure close to the 3{${'}$} end of the mature RNA, and this 3{${'}$} end is generated by cleavage using a machinery involving the U7 snRNP and protein factors such as the stem\textendash{}loop binding protein (SLBP). This machinery of 3{${'}$} end processing is related to that of polyadenylation as protein components are shared between the systems. It is commonly believed that histone 3{${'}$} end processing is restricted to metazoa and green algae. In contrast, polyadenylation is ubiquitous in Eukarya. However, using computational approaches, we have now identified components of histone 3{${'}$} end processing in a number of protozoa. Thus, the histone mRNA stem\textendash{}loop structure as well as the SLBP protein are present in many different protozoa, including Dictyostelium, alveolates, Trypanosoma, and Trichomonas. These results show that the histone 3{${'}$} end processing machinery is more ancient than previously anticipated and can be traced to the root of the eukaryotic phylogenetic tree. We also identified histone mRNAs from both metazoa and protozoa that are polyadenylated but also contain the signals characteristic of histone 3{${'}$} end processing. These results provide further evidence that some histone genes are regulated at the level of 3{${'}$} end processing to produce either polyadenylated RNAs or RNAs with the 3{${'}$} end characteristic of replication-dependent histone mRNAs.},

  abstract = {Actin is not only one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells, but also one of the most versatile. In addition to its familiar involvement in enabling contraction and establishing cellular motility and scaffolding in the cytosol, actin has well-documented roles in a variety of processes within the confines of the nucleus, such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. Interestingly, monomeric actin as well as actin-related proteins (Arps) are found as stoichiometric subunits of a variety of chromatin remodeling complexes and histone acetyltransferases, raising the question of precisely what roles they serve in these contexts. Actin and Arps are present in unique combinations in chromatin modifiers, helping to establish structural integrity of the complex and enabling a wide range of functions, such as recruiting the complex to nucleosomes to facilitate chromatin remodeling and promoting ATPase activity of the catalytic subunit. Actin and Arps are also thought to help modulate chromatin dynamics and maintain higher-order chromatin structure. Moreover, the presence of actin and Arps in several chromatin modifiers is necessary for promoting genomic integrity and an effective DNA damage response. In this review, we discuss the involvement of actin and Arps in these nuclear complexes that control chromatin remodeling and histone modifications, while also considering avenues for future study to further shed light on their functional importance.},

Nucleosome positions affect the transcription by impeding or facilitating the binding of transcription factors. The DNA sequence, especially the periodic occurrences of dinucleotides, is a major factor that affects the nucleosome positioning. We analyzed the Drosophila DNA sequences bound by H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes. Periodic patterns of dinucleotides (weak\textendash{}weak/strong\textendash{}strong or purine\textendash{}purine/pyrimidine\textendash{}pyrimidine) were identified as WW/SS and RR/YY nucleosome positioning sequence (NPS) patterns. The WW/SS NPS pattern of the H2A nucleosome has a 10-bp period of weak\textendash{}weak/strong\textendash{}strong (W 5 A or T; S 5 G or C) dinucleotides. The 10-bp periodicity, however, is disrupted in the middle of the sequence. At the dyad, the SS dinucleotide is preferred. On the other hand, the RR/YY NPS pattern has an 18-bp periodicity of purine\textendash{}purine/pyrimidine\textendash{}pyrimidine (R 5 A or G; Y 5 T or C) dinucleotides. The NPS patterns from H2A.Z nucleosomes differ from the NPS patterns from H2A nucleosomes. The RR/YY pattern of H2A.Z nucleosomes has major peaks shifted by 10 bp deviated from the H2A nucleosome pattern. The H2A and H2A.Z nucleosomes have different sequence preferences.

Despite many progresses being made in the identification of protein coding regions by computational methods during the last two decades, the performances and efficiencies of the prediction methods still need to be improved. In addition, it is indispensable to develop different prediction methods since combining different methods may greatly improve the prediction accuracy. A new method to predict protein coding regions is developed in this paper based on the fact that most of exon sequences have a 3-base periodicity, while intron sequences do not have this unique feature. The method computes the 3-base periodicity and the background noise of the stepwise DNA segments of the target DNA sequences using nucleotide distributions in the three codon positions of the DNA sequences. Exon and intron sequences can be identified from trends of the ratio of the 3-base periodicity to the background noise in the DNA sequences. Case studies on genes from different organisms show that this method is an effective approach for exon prediction.},

  volume = {8},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Background: Unraveling the mechanisms that regulate gene expression is a major challenge in biology. An important task in this challenge is to identify regulatory elements, especially the binding sites in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for transcription factors. These binding sites are short DNA segments that are called motifs. Recent advances in genome sequence availability and in highthroughput gene expression analysis technologies have allowed for the development of computational methods for motif finding. As a result, a large number of motif finding algorithms have been implemented and applied to various motif models over the past decade. This survey reviews the latest developments in DNA motif finding algorithms.
Results: Earlier algorithms use promoter sequences of coregulated genes from single genome and search for statistically overrepresented motifs. Recent algorithms are designed to use phylogenetic footprinting or orthologous sequences and also an integrated approach where promoter sequences of coregulated genes and phylogenetic footprinting are used. All the algorithms studied have been reported to correctly detect the motifs that have been previously detected by laboratory experimental approaches, and some algorithms were able to find novel motifs. However, most of these motif finding algorithms have been shown to work successfully in yeast and other lower organisms, but perform significantly worse in higher organisms.
Conclusion: Despite considerable efforts to date, DNA motif finding remains a complex challenge for biologists and computer scientists. Researchers have taken many different approaches in developing motif discovery tools and the progress made in this area of research is very encouraging. Performance comparison of different motif finding tools and identification of the best tools have proven to be a difficult task because tools are designed based on algorithms and motif models that are diverse and complex and our incomplete understanding of the biology of regulatory mechanism does not always provide adequate evaluation of underlying algorithms over motif models.},

  issn = {15687864},
  abstract = {Maintenance of a genome requires DNA repair integrated with chromatin remodeling. We have analyzed six transcriptome data sets and one data set on translational regulation of known DNA repair and remodeling genes in synchronized human cells. These data are available through our new database: www.dnarepairgenes.com. Genes that have similar transcription profiles in at least two of our data sets generally agree well with known protein profiles. In brief, long patch base excision repair (BER) is enriched for S phase genes, whereas short patch BER uses genes essentially equally expressed in all cell cycle phases. Furthermore, most genes related to DNA mismatch repair, Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination have their highest expression in the S phase. In contrast, genes specific for direct repair, nucleotide excision repair, as well as non-homologous end joining do not show cell cycle-related expression. Cell cycle regulated chromatin remodeling genes were most frequently confined to G1/S and S. These include e.g. genes for chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) major subunits CHAF1A and CHAF1B; the putative helicases HELLS and ATAD2 that both co-activate E2F transcription factors central in G1/S-transition and recruit DNA repair and chromatin-modifying proteins and DNA double strand break repair proteins; and RAD54L and RAD54B involved in double strand break repair. TOP2A was consistently most highly expressed in G2, but also expressed in late S phase, supporting a role in regulating entry into mitosis. Translational regulation complements transcriptional regulation and appears to be a relatively common cell cycle regulatory mechanism for DNA repair genes. Our results identify cell cycle phases in which different pathways have highest activity, and demonstrate that periodically expressed genes in a pathway are frequently co-expressed. Furthermore, the data suggest that S phase expression and over-expression of some multifunctional chromatin remodeling proteins may set up feedback loops driving cancer cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase\textendash{}seq) from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase\textendash{}seq fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned\textemdash{}in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.},

Current chromatin accessibility assays are used to separate the genome by enzymatic or chemical means and isolate either the accessible or protected locations. The isolated DNA is then quantified using a next-generation sequencing platform. Wide application of these assays has recently focused on the identification of the instrumental epigenetic changes responsible for differential gene expression, cell proliferation, functional diversification and disease development. Here we discuss the limitations and advantages of current genome-wide chromatin accessibility assays with especial attention on experimental precautions and sequence data analysis.

  abstract = {Background: Correct temporal and spatial gene expression during metazoan development relies on combinatorial interactions between different transcription factors. As a consequence, cisregulatory elements often colocalize in clusters termed cis-regulatory modules. These may have requirements on organizational features such as spacing, order and helical phasing (periodic spacing) between binding sites. Due to the turning of the DNA helix, a small modification of the distance between a pair of sites may sometimes drastically disrupt function, while insertion of a full helical turn of DNA (10\textendash{}11 bp) between cis elements may cause functionality to be restored. Recently, de novo motif discovery methods which incorporate organizational properties such as colocalization and order preferences have been developed, but there are no tools which incorporate periodic spacing into the model.
Results: We have developed a web based motif discovery tool, HeliCis, which features a flexible model which allows de novo detection of motifs with periodic spacing. Depending on the parameter settings it may also be used for discovering colocalized motifs without periodicity or motifs separated by a fixed gap of known or unknown length. We show on simulated data that it can efficiently capture the synergistic effects of colocalization and periodic spacing to improve detection of weak DNA motifs. It provides a simple to use web interface which interactively visualizes the current settings and thereby makes it easy to understand the parameters and the model structure.
Conclusion: HeliCis provides simple and efficient de novo discovery of colocalized DNA motif pairs, with or without periodic spacing. Our evaluations show that it can detect weak periodic patterns which are not easily discovered using a sequential approach, i.e. first finding the binding sites and second analyzing the properties of their pairwise distances.},

  abstract = {DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors use DNA-binding domains (DBDs) to bind to specific sequences in the genome to initiate many important biological functions. Accurate prediction of such target sequences, often represented by position weight matrices (PWMs), is an important step to understand many biological processes. Recent studies have shown that knowledge-based potential functions can be applied on protein-DNA co-crystallized structures to generate PWMs that are considerably consistent with experimental data. However, this success has not been extended to DNA-binding proteins lacking co-crystallized structures. This study aims at investigating the possibility of predicting the DNA sequences bound by DNA-binding proteins from the proteins' unbound structures (structures of the unbound state). Given an unbound query protein and a template complex, the proposed method first employs structure alignment to generate synthetic proteinDNA complexes for the query protein. Once a complex is available, an atomic-level knowledge-based potential function is employed to predict PWMs characterizing the sequences to which the query protein can bind. The evaluation of the proposed method is based on seven DNA-binding proteins, which have structures of both DNA-bound and unbound forms for prediction as well as annotated PWMs for validation. Since this work is the first attempt to predict target sequences of DNA-binding proteins from their unbound structures, three types of structural variations that presumably influence the prediction accuracy were examined and discussed. Based on the analyses conducted in this study, the conformational change of proteins upon binding DNA was shown to be the key factor. This study sheds light on the challenge of predicting the target DNA sequences of a protein lacking co-crystallized structures, which encourages more efforts on the structure alignment-based approaches in addition to docking- and homology modeling-based approaches for generating synthetic complexes.},

  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Background: Development of high-throughput methods for measuring DNA interactions of transcription factors together with computational advances in short motif inference algorithms is expanding our understanding of transcription factor binding site motifs. The consequential growth of sequence motif data sets makes it important to systematically group and categorise regulatory motifs. It has been shown that there are familial tendencies in DNA sequence motifs that are predictive of the family of factors that binds them. Further development of methods that detect and describe familial motif trends has the potential to help in measuring the similarity of novel computational motif predictions to previously known data and sensitively detecting regulatory motifs similar to previously known ones from novel sequence.
Results: We propose a probabilistic model for position weight matrix (PWM) sequence motif families. The model, which we call the `metamotif' describes recurring familial patterns in a set of motifs. The metamotif framework models variation within a family of sequence motifs. It allows for simultaneous estimation of a series of independent metamotifs from input position weight matrix (PWM) motif data and does not assume that all input motif columns contribute to a familial pattern. We describe an algorithm for inferring metamotifs from weight matrix data. We then demonstrate the use of the model in two practical tasks: in the Bayesian NestedMICA model inference algorithm as a PWM prior to enhance motif inference sensitivity, and in a motif classification task where motifs are labelled according to their interacting DNA binding domain.
Conclusions: We show that metamotifs can be used as PWM priors in the NestedMICA motif inference algorithm to dramatically increase the sensitivity to infer motifs. Metamotifs were also successfully applied to a motif classification problem where sequence motif features were used to predict the family of protein DNA binding domains that would interact with it. The metamotif based classifier is shown to compare favourably to previous related methods. The metamotif has great potential for further use in machine learning tasks related to especially de novo computational sequence motif inference. The metamotif methods presented have been incorporated into the NestedMICA suite.},

However, the use of a newly developed inference strategy called Nested Sampling means NestedMICA is able to find optimal solutions without the need for a problematic initialization or seeding step. We investigate the performance of NestedMICA in a range scenario, on synthetic data and a well-characterized set of muscle regulatory regions, and compare it with the popular MEME program. We show that the new method is significantly more sensitive than MEME: in one case, it successfully extracted a target motif from background sequence four times longer than could be handled by the existing program. It also performs robustly on synthetic sequences containing multiple significant motifs. When tested on a real set of regulatory sequences, NestedMICA produced motifs which were good predictors for all five abundant classes of annotated binding sites.},

  abstract = {Background: Enhancers, not promoters, are the most dynamic in their DNA methylation status throughout development and differentiation. Generally speaking, enhancers that are primed to or actually drive gene expression are characterized by relatively low levels of DNA methylation (hypo-methylation), while inactive enhancers display hyper-methylation of the underlying DNA. The direct functional significance of the DNA methylation state of enhancers is, however, unclear for most loci.
Results: In contrast to conventional epigenetic interactions at enhancers, we find that DNA methylation status and enhancer activity during early zebrafish development display very unusual correlation characteristics: hypo-methylation is a unique feature of primed enhancers whereas active enhancers are generally hyper-methylated. The hypo-methylated enhancers that we identify (hypo-enhancers) are enriched close to important transcription factors that act later in development. Interestingly, hypo-enhancers are de-methylated shortly before the midblastula transition and reside in a unique epigenetic environment. Finally, we demonstrate that hypo-enhancers do become active at later developmental stages and that they are physically associated with the transcriptional start site of target genes, irrespective of target gene activity.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that early development in zebrafish embodies a time window characterized by non-canonical DNA methylation\textendash{}enhancer relationships, including global DNA hypo-methylation of inactive enhancers and DNA hyper-methylation of active enhancers.},

  abstract = {Population synthesis is concerned with the generation of synthetic yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in the modeling of transport where the synthetic populations of micro agents represent a key input to most agent-based models. In this paper, a new methodological framework for how to grow pools of micro agents is presented. This is accomplished by adopting a deep generative modeling approach from machine learning based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework. Compared to the previous population synthesis approaches based on Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling or traditional generative models, the proposed method allows unparalleled scalability with respect to the number and types of attributes. In contrast to the approaches that rely on approximating the joint distribution in the observed data space, VAE learns its compressed latent representation. The advantage of the compressed representation is that it avoids the problem of the generated samples being trapped in local minima when the number of attributes becomes large.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming is becoming an attractive approach to probabilistic machine learning. Through relieving researchers from the tedious burden of hand-deriving inference algorithms, not only does it enable development of more accurate and interpretable models but it also encourages reproducible research. However, successful probabilistic programming systems require flexible, generic and efficient inference engines. In this work, we present a system called Turing for flexible composable probabilistic programming inference. Turing has a intuitive modeling syntax and supports a wide range of sampling based inference algorithms. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines Markov chain sampling operations on subsets of model variables, e.g. using a combination of a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine. This composable inference engine allows the user to easily switch between black-box style inference methods such as HMC, and customized inference methods. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable inference engines to the community and encourage other researchers to build on this system to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning.},

While warfare remains a contentious subject, considerable evidence supports the view that warfare is a strategy by which coalitions of males cooperate to acquire and defend resources necessary for reproduction. This strategy is not the result of a single ``instinct'' for war, but is instead an emergent property resulting from evolved psychological mechanisms (such as xenophobia and parochial altruism). These mechanisms are sensitive to ecological and social conditions, such that the prevalence and patterns of warfare vary according to subsistence strategies, military technology, cultural institutions, and political and economic relations. When economic conditions enable intergroup relations to change from zero-sum to positive-sum games, peaceful intergroup relations can emerge.},

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so. We demonstrate these algorithms on a non-linear state space model and a L{\'e}vy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

The purpose of this paper is to compare the EM and MCMC approaches in three cases of different complexity; the examples include model order selection, continuous-time HMMs and variants of HMMs in which the observed data depends on many hidden variables in an overlapping fashion. All these examples in some way or another originate from real-data applications. Neither EM nor MCMC analysis of HMMs is a black-box methodology without need for user-interaction, and we will illustrate some of the problems, like poor mixing and long computation times, one may expect to encounter.},

Separate HMM modules were designed and trained for specific regions of DNA: exons, introns, intergenic regions, and splice sites. The models were then tied together to form a biologically feasible topology. The integrated HMM was trained further on a set of eukaryotic DNA sequences and tested by using it to segment a separate set of sequences. The resulting HMM system which is called VEIL (Viterbi Exon-Intron Locator), obtains an overall accuracy on test data of 92\% of total bases correctly labelled, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73. Using the more stringent test of exact exon prediction, VEIL correctly located both ends of 53\% of the coding exons, and 49\% of the exons it predicts are exactly correct. These results compare favorably to the best previous results for gene structure prediction and demonstrate the benefits of using HMMs for this problem.},

This algorithm has several advantages over traditional distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms. (1) It defines a probabilistic model of the data which can be used to compute the predictive distribution of a test point and the probability of it belonging to any of the existing clusters in the tree. (2) It uses a model-based criterion to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are advantageous and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up approximate inference method for a Dirichlet process (i.e. countably infinite) mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning the model hyperparameters, computing the predictive distribution, and extensions to the algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate useful properties of the algorithm.},

Previously, embedded HMM methods were only applicable to low-dimensional state-space models. We demonstrate that using our proposed pool state selection scheme, an embedded HMM sampler can have similar performance to a well-tuned sampler that uses a combination of Particle Gibbs with Backward Sampling (PGBS) and Metropolis updates. The scaling to higher dimensions is made possible by selecting pool states locally near the current value of the state sequence. The proposed pool state selection scheme also allows each iteration of the embedded HMM sampler to take time linear in the number of the pool states, as opposed to quadratic as in the original embedded HMM sampler.},

  volume = {19},

  abstract = {Background: MicroRNA regulation is fundamentally responsible for fine-tuning the whole gene network in human and has been implicated in most physiological and pathological conditions. Studying regulatory impact of microRNA on various cellular and disease processes has resulted in numerous computational tools that investigate microRNA-mRNA interactions through the prediction of static binding site highly dependent on sequence pairing. However, what hindered the practical use of such target prediction is the interplay between competing and cooperative microRNA binding that complicates the whole regulatory process exceptionally.
Results: We developed a new method for improved microRNA target prediction based on Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) using a large collection of molecular features associated with microRNA, mRNA, and the interaction sites. Multiple validations based on microRNA-mRNA interactions reported in recent large-scale sequencing analyses and a screening test on the entire human transcriptome show that our model outperformed several state-of-the-art tools in terms of promising predictive power on binding sites specific to transcript isoforms with reduced false positive prediction. Last, we illustrated the use of predicted targets in constructing conditional microRNA-mediated gene regulation networks in human cancer.
Conclusion: The probability-based binding site prediction provides not only a useful tool for differentiating microRNA targets according to the estimated binding potential but also a capability highly important for exploring dynamic regulation where binding competition is involved.},

Such modeling is difficult due to the fact that the number of known protein structures available to estimate these torsion angle distributions is typically small. Furthermore, the data is "sparse" in that not all proteins have angle pairs at each sequence position. We propose a new semiparametric model for the joint distributions of angle pairs at multiple sequence positions. Our model accommodates sparse data by leveraging known information about the behavior of protein secondary structure. We demonstrate our technique by predicting the torsion angles in a loop from the globin fold family. Our results show that a template-based approach can now be successfully extended to modeling the notoriously difficult loop and turn regions.},

  abstract = {The problem of inferring the population structure, linkage disequilibrium pattern, and chromosomal recombination hotspots from genetic polymorphism data is essential for understanding the origin and characteristics of genome variations, with important applications to the genetic analysis of disease propensities and other complex traits. Statistical genetic methodologies developed so far mostly address these problems separately using specialized models ranging from coalescence and admixture models for population structures, to hidden Markov models and renewal processes for recombination; but most of these approaches ignore the inherent uncertainty in the genetic complexity (e.g., the number of genetic founders of a population) of the data and the close statistical and biological relationships among objects studied in these problems. We present a new statistical framework called hidden Markov Dirichlet process (HMDP) to jointly model the genetic recombinations among a possibly infinite number of founders and the coalescence-with-mutation events in the resulting genealogies. The HMDP posits that a haplotype of genetic markers is generated by a sequence of recombination events that select an ancestor for each locus from an unbounded set of founders according to a 1st-order Markov transition process. Conjoining this process with a mutation model, our method accommodates both between-lineage recombination and within-lineage sequence variations, and leads to a compact and natural interpretation of the population structure and inheritance process underlying haplotype data. We have developed an efficient sampling algorithm for HMDP based on a two-level nested P\textasciiacute{}olya urn scheme, and we present experimental results on joint inference of population structure, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination hotspots based on HMDP. On both simulated and real SNP haplotype data, our method performs competitively or significantly better than extant methods in uncovering the recombination hotspots along chromosomal loci; and in addition it also infers the ancestral genetic patterns and offers a highly accurate map of ancestral compositions of modern populations.},

  abstract = {I introduce a family of prior distributions over multivariate distributions, based on the use of a ``Dirichlet diffusion tree'' to generate exchangeable data sets. These priors can be viewed as generalizations of Dirichlet processes and of Dirichlet process mixtures, but unlike simple mixtures, they can capture the hierarchical structure present in many distributions, by means of the latent diffusion tree underlying the data. This latent tree also provides a hierarchical clustering of the data, which, unlike ad hoc clustering methods, comes with probabilistic indications of uncertainty. The relevance of each variable to the clustering can also be determined. Although Dirichlet diffusion trees are defined in terms of a continuoustime process, posterior inference involves only finite-dimensional quantities, allowing computation to be performed by reasonably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The methods are demonstrated on problems of modeling a two-dimensional density and of clustering gene expression data.},

In many respects, Bayesian methods have proven to be vastly superior to more traditional statistical tools, offering the advantage of higher efficiency and of a consistent conceptual basis for dealing with the problem of induction in the presence of uncertainty. This trend is likely to continue in the future, when the way we collect, manipulate and analyse observations and compare them with theoretical models will assume an even more central role in cosmology. This review is an introduction to Bayesian methods in cosmology and astrophysics and recent results in the field. I first present Bayesian probability theory and its conceptual underpinnings, Bayes' Theorem and the role of priors. I discuss the problem of parameter inference and its general solution, along with numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. I then review the theory and application of Bayesian model comparison, discussing the notions of Bayesian evidence and effective model complexity, and how to compute and interpret those quantities. Recent developments in cosmological parameter extraction and Bayesian cosmological model building are summarized, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead.},

To identify the genes involved in the morphogenesis of the principal glial cell type in the vertebrate retina, the M{\"u}ller glia (MG), we used genomic and CRISPR based strategies in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We identified 41 genes involved in various aspects of MG cell morphogenesis and revealed a striking concordance between the sequential steps of anatomical feature addition and the expression of cohorts of functionally related genes that regulate these steps. We noted that the many of the genes preferentially expressed in zebrafish MG showed conservation in glia across species suggesting evolutionarily conserved glial developmental pathways.},

In this context, one of the most successful and popular approximation techniques is the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, also known as particle filtering. Nevertheless, this method tends to be inefficient when applied to high dimensional problems. In this paper, we focus on another class of sequential inference methods, namely the Sequential Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SMCMC) techniques, which represent a promising alternative to SMC methods. After providing a unifying framework for the class of SMCMC approaches, we propose novel efficient strategies based on the principle of Langevin diffusion and Hamiltonian dynamics in order to cope with the increasing number of high-dimensional applications. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve significantly better performance compared to existing algorithms.},

Sequence analysis of the region encoding these functions revealed three open reading frames, two (iuxL and iuxM) that are required for production of an autoinducer substance and a third (luxN) that is required for response to this signal substance. The LuxL and LuxM proteins are not similar in amino acid sequence to other proteins in the database, but the LuxN protein contains regions of sequence resembling both the histidine protein kinase and the response regulator domains of the family of two-component, signal transduction proteins. The phenotypes of mutants with tuxL, iuxM and iuxN defects indicated that an additional signal-response system controlling density-dependent expression of luminescence remains to be identified.},

Before the financial crisis, reserve balances were roughly \$20 billion whereas the level has risen well past \$1 trillion. The effect of reserve balances in simple macroeconomic models often comes through the money multiplier, affecting the money supply and the amount of bank lending in the economy. Most models currently used for macroeconomic policy analysis, however, either exclude money or model money demand as entirely endogenous, thus precluding any causal role for reserves and money. Nevertheless, some academic research and many textbooks continue to use the money multiplier concept in discussions of money. We explore the institutional structure of the transmission mechanism beginning with open market operations through to money and loans. We then undertake empirical analysis of the relationship among reserve balances, money, and bank lending. We use aggregate as well as bank-level data in a VAR framework and document that the mechanism does not work through the standard multiplier model or the bank lending channel. In particular, if the level of reserve balances is expected to have an impact on the economy, it seems unlikely that a standard multiplier story will explain the effect.},

We have carefully analysed this paper, and found methodological inconsistencies and calculation errors that, in combination, render its conclusions not scientifically sound. Ferroni and Hopkirk adopt `extended' boundaries for their analysis of PV without acknowledging that such choice of boundaries makes their results incompatible with those for all other technologies that have been analysed using more conventional boundaries, including nuclear energy with which the authors engage in multiple inconsistent comparisons. In addition, they use out-dated information, make invalid assumptions on PV specifications and other key parameters, and conduct calculation errors, including double counting. We herein provide revised EROI calculations for PV electricity in Switzerland, adopting both conventional and `extended' system boundaries, to contrast with their results, which points to an order-ofmagnitude underestimate of the EROI of PV in Switzerland by Ferroni and Hopkirk.},

In examining the structure of the economy, we distinguish between the energy embodied in capital assets used in the production and distribution of energy and that embodied in capital assets and goods that consume energy. Sources used to quantify the energy flows include: end-use energy data by economic sector; International Energy Agency\textendash{}style national energy balances, and national input-output tables. As an example, the Canadian economy for 2008 produced 16.97 exajoules (EJ) of energy, which after net export of 6.16 EJ and other adjustments left a total primary energy consumption of 10.61 EJ. The energy supply and distribution sectors used close to 32\% (3.36 EJ) of total primary consumption. Analysis of primary energy consumption shows that 25.14\% was embodied in household consumption, 22.85\% was consumed directly by households, 7.88\% was embodied in government services, and 34.07\% was embodied in exports. Of significance to economic growth, 7.14\% was embodied in capital in energy demanding sectors, 1.25\% in energy consuming personal assets, and 1.52\% in supply sector capital. The energy return on energy investment was relatively constant, averaging 5.14 between 1990 and 2008. Capital investments required to decouple the Canadian economy from its dependence on fossil fuels are discerned.},

Until recently, cheap and seemingly limitless fossil energy has allowed most of society to ignore the importance of contributions to the economic process from the biophysical world as well as the potential limits to growth. This paper centers on assessing the energy costs of modern day society and its relation to GDP. Our most important focus is the characteristics of our major energy sources including each fuel's energy return on investment (EROI). The EROI of our most important fuels is declining and most renewable and nonconventional energy alternatives have substantially lower EROI values than traditional conventional fossil fuels. At the societal level, declining EROI means that an increasing proportion of energy output and economic activity must be diverted to attaining the energy needed to run an economy, leaving less discretionary funds available for ``non-essential'' purchases which often drive growth. The declining EROI of traditional fossil fuel energy sources and the effect of that on the world economy are likely to result in a myriad of consequences, most of which will not be perceived as good.},

  abstract = {Eye formation in vertebrates involves highly coordinated processes, and the differentiation of various eye tissues is regulated by conserved transcription factors and signalling pathways. Mutations in key genes of the regulatory hierarchy lead to congenital disorders and ocular diseases.The Wnt signalling pathway plays a key role in different aspects of eye development, and several Wnt receptors of the Frizzled family are required for eye specification and differentiation. However, their precise function in these processes remains elusive. Here we show that mutation of the frizzled8a gene in zebrafish leads to microphthalmia. The differentiation of retinal layers is delayed, and retinal progenitor cells in microphthalmic embryos fail to normally exit the cell cycle to enter into the post-mitotic state. They exhibit delayed differentiation associated with enhanced apoptosis, which results in abnormal lamination of retinal layers, reduction in the number of retinal cells, and small eye phenotype. These findings suggest that Frizzled8a plays a specific role in regulating cell cycle progression during the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells.},

  title = {A Linear Memory Algorithm for {{Baum}}-{{Welch}} Training},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {14712105},
  abstract = {Background: Baum-Welch training is an expectation-maximisation algorithm for training the emission and transition probabilities of hidden Markov models in a fully automated way. It can be employed as long as a training set of annotated sequences is known, and provides a rigorous way to derive parameter values which are guaranteed to be at least locally optimal. For complex hidden Markov models such as pair hidden Markov models and very long training sequences, even the most efficient algorithms for Baum-Welch training are currently too memory-consuming. This has so far effectively prevented the automatic parameter training of hidden Markov models that are currently used for biological sequence analyses.
Results: We introduce the first linear space algorithm for Baum-Welch training. For a hidden Markov model with M states, T free transition and E free emission parameters, and an input sequence of length L, our new algorithm requires O(M) memory and O(LMTmax (T + E)) time for one Baum-Welch iteration, where Tmax is the maximum number of states that any state is connected to. The most memory efficient algorithm until now was the checkpointing algorithm with O(log(L)M) memory and O(log(L)LMTmax) time requirement. Our novel algorithm thus renders the memory requirement completely independent of the length of the training sequences. More generally, for an n-hidden Markov model and n input sequences of length L, the memory requirement of O(log(L)Ln-1 M) is reduced to O(Ln-1 M) memory while the running time is changed from O(log(L)Ln MTmax + Ln(T + E)) to O(Ln MTmax (T + E)). An added advantage of our new algorithm is that a reduced time requirement can be traded for an increased memory requirement and vice versa, such that for any c {$\in$} \{1, ..., (T + E)\}, a time requirement of Ln MTmax c incurs a memory requirement of Ln-1 M(T + E - c).
Conclusion: For the large class of hidden Markov models used for example in gene prediction, whose number of states does not scale with the length of the input sequence, our novel algorithm can thus be both faster and more memory-efficient than any of the existing algorithms.},

  title = {Implementing {{EM}} and {{Viterbi}} Algorithms for {{Hidden Markov Model}} in Linear Memory},
  volume = {9},
  issn = {1471-2105},
  abstract = {Background: The Baum-Welch learning procedure for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provides a powerful tool for tailoring HMM topologies to data for use in knowledge discovery and clustering. A linear memory procedure recently proposed by Mikl{\'o}s, I. and Meyer, I.M. describes a memory sparse version of the Baum-Welch algorithm with modifications to the original probabilistic table topologies to make memory use independent of sequence length (and linearly dependent on state number). The original description of the technique has some errors that we amend. We then compare the corrected implementation on a variety of data sets with conventional and checkpointing implementations.
Results: We provide a correct recurrence relation for the emission parameter estimate and extend it to parameter estimates of the Normal distribution. To accelerate estimation of the prior state probabilities, and decrease memory use, we reverse the originally proposed forward sweep. We describe different scaling strategies necessary in all real implementations of the algorithm to prevent underflow. In this paper we also describe our approach to a linear memory implementation of the Viterbi decoding algorithm (with linearity in the sequence length, while memory use is approximately independent of state number). We demonstrate the use of the linear memory implementation on an extended Duration Hidden Markov Model (DHMM) and on an HMM with a spike detection topology. Comparing the various implementations of the Baum-Welch procedure we find that the checkpointing algorithm produces the best overall tradeoff between memory use and speed. In cases where sequence length is very large (for Baum-Welch), or state number is very large (for Viterbi), the linear memory methods outlined may offer some utility.
Conclusion: Our performance-optimized Java implementations of Baum-Welch algorithm are available at http://logos.cs.uno.edu/\textasciitilde{}achurban. The described method and implementations will aid sequence alignment, gene structure prediction, HMM profile training, nanopore ionic flow blockades analysis and many other domains that require efficient HMM training with EM.},

This recursion allows us to obtain the conditional distribution of the latent state at every occasion, given the previous state and the observed data. With respect to the estimation algorithm based on the well-known Baum-Welch recursions, which requires an amount of memory that increases with the sample size, the proposed algorithm also has the advantage of not requiring dummy renormalizations to avoid numerical problems. Moreover, it directly allows us to perform global decoding of the latent sequence of states, without the need of a Viterbi method and with a consistent reduction of the memory requirement with respect to the latter. The proposed approach is compared, in terms of computing time and memory requirement, with the algorithm based on the Baum-Welch recursions and with the so-called linear memory algorithm of Churbanov and Winters-Hilt. The comparison is also based on a series of simulations involving an HM model for continuous time-series data.},

  issn = {00200255},
  abstract = {The performance of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) targeted for complex real-world applications are often degraded because they are designed a priori using limited training data and prior knowledge, and because the classification environment changes during operations. Incremental learning of new data sequences allows to adapt HMM parameters as new data becomes available, without having to retrain from the start on all accumulated training data. This paper presents a survey of techniques found in literature that are suitable for incremental learning of HMM parameters. These techniques are classified according to the objective function, optimization technique and target application, involving block-wise and symbol-wise learning of parameters. Convergence properties of these techniques are presented along with an analysis of time and memory complexity. In addition, the challenges faced when these techniques are applied to incremental learning is assessed for scenarios in which the new training data is limited and abundant. While the convergence rate and resource requirements are critical factors when incremental learning is performed through one pass over abundant stream of data, effective stopping criteria and management of validation sets are important when learning is performed through several iterations over limited data. In both cases managing the learning rate to integrate preexisting knowledge and new data is crucial for maintaining a high level of performance. Finally, this paper underscores the need for empirical benchmarking studies among techniques presented in literature, and proposes several evaluation criteria based on non-parametric statistical testing to facilitate the selection of techniques given a particular application domain.},

  abstract = {Many astrophysical sources, especially compact accreting sources, show strong, random brightness fluctuations with broad power spectra in addition to periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) that have narrower spectra. The random nature of the dominant source of variance greatly complicates the process of searching for possible weak periodic signals. We have addressed this problem using the tools of Bayesian statistics; in particular, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters, and posterior predictive model checking to assess model fits and search for periodogram outliers that may represent periodic signals. The methods developed are applied to two example data sets, both long XMM\textendash{}Newton observations of highly variable Seyfert 1 galaxies: RE J1034 + 396 and Mrk 766. In both cases, a bend (or break) in the power spectrum is evident. In the case of RE J1034 + 396, the previously reported QPO is found but with somewhat weaker statistical significance than reported in previous analyses. The difference is due partly to the improved continuum modelling, better treatment of nuisance parameters and partly to different data selection methods.},

  abstract = {Nested sampling is an iterative integration procedure that shrinks the prior volume towards higher likelihoods by removing a "live" point at a time. A replacement point is drawn uniformly from the prior above an ever-increasing likelihood threshold. Thus, the problem of drawing from a space above a certain likelihood value arises naturally in nested sampling, making algorithms that solve this problem a key ingredient to the nested sampling framework. If the drawn points are distributed uniformly, the removal of a point shrinks the volume in a well-understood way, and the integration of nested sampling is unbiased. In this work, I develop a statistical test to check whether this is the case. This "Shrinkage Test" is useful to verify nested sampling algorithms in a controlled environment. I apply the shrinkage test to a test-problem, and show that some existing algorithms fail to pass it due to over-optimisation. I then demonstrate that a simple algorithm can be constructed which is robust against this type of problem. This RADFRIENDS algorithm is, however, inefficient in comparison to MULTINEST.},

Many highly convergent adaptations are also complex, which makes their repeated emergence surprising. In plants, the evolutionary history of two carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) \textemdash{} C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthesis \textemdash{} presents such a paradox. Both of these modifications of ancestral C3 photosynthesis require the integration of multiple anatomical and biochemical components, yet together they have evolved more than one hundred times. The presence of CCM enzymes in all plants suggests that a rudimentary CCM might emerge via relatively few genetic changes in potentiated lineages. Here, we propose that many of the complexities often associated with C4 and CAM photosynthesis may have evolved during a post-emergence optimization phase. The ongoing development of new model clades for young, emerging CCMs is enabling the comparative studies needed to test these ideas.},

Projection only captures the outline of the object, and discards the internal information that may be crucial for the recognition. In this paper, we stay in 3D and concentrate on tapping the potential of 3D representations. We present NormalNet, a voxel-based convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for 3D object recognition. The network uses normal vectors of the object surfaces as input, which demonstrate stronger discrimination capability than binary voxels. We propose a reflection\textendash{}convolution\textendash{}concatenation (RCC) module to realize the conv layers, which extracts distinguishable features for 3D vision tasks while reducing the number of parameters significantly. We further improve the performance of NormalNet by combining two networks, which take normal vectors and voxels as input respectively. We carry out a series of experiments that validate the design of the network and achieve competitive performance in 3D object classification and retrieval tasks.},

  abstract = {Improving the effectiveness of spatial shape features classification from 3D lidar data is very relevant because it is largely used as a fundamental step towards higher level scene understanding challenges of autonomous vehicles and terrestrial robots. In this sense, computing neighborhood for points in dense scans becomes a costly process for both training and classification. This paper proposes a new general framework for implementing and comparing different supervised learning classifiers with a simple voxel-based neighborhood computation where points in each non-overlapping voxel in a regular grid are assigned to the same class by considering features within a support region defined by the voxel itself. The contribution provides offline training and online classification procedures as well as five alternative feature vector definitions based on principal component analysis for scatter, tubular and planar shapes. Moreover, the feasibility of this approach is evaluated by implementing a neural network (NN) method previously proposed by the authors as well as three other supervised learning classifiers found in scene processing methods: support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes (GP), and Gaussian mixture models (GMM). A comparative performance analysis is presented using real point clouds from both natural and urban environments and two different 3D rangefinders (a tilting Hokuyo UTM-30LX and a Riegl). Classification performance metrics and processing time measurements confirm the benefits of the NN classifier and the feasibility of voxel-based neighborhood.},

Our analysis shows that multiview methods continue to o{$\carriagereturn$}er the best generalization even without pretraining on large labeled image datasets, and even when trained on simplified inputs such as binary silhouettes. Furthermore, the performance of voxel-based 3D convolutional networks and point-based architectures can be improved via cross-modal transfer from image representations. Finally, we analyze the robustness of 3D shape classifiers to adversarial transformations and present a novel approach for generating adversarial perturbations of a 3D shape for multiview classifiers using a di{$\carriagereturn$}erentiable renderer. We find that point-based networks are more robust to point position perturbations while voxel-based and multiview networks are easily fooled with the addition of imperceptible noise to the input.},

In this work, we propose a deep learning based face normal filtering scheme for mesh denoising, called NormalNet. Different from natural images, for mesh, it is difficult to collect enough examples to build a robust end-to-end training scheme for deep networks. To remedy this problem, we propose an iterative framework to generate enough face-normal pairs, based on which a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based scheme is designed for guidance normal learning. Moreover, to facilitate the 3D convolution operation in CNNs, for each face in mesh, we propose a voxelization strategy to transform irregular local mesh structure into regular 4D-array form. Finally, guided normal filtering is performed to obtain filtered face normals, according to which denoised positions of vertices are derived. Compared to the state-of-the-art works, the proposed scheme can generate accurate guidance normals and remove noise effectively while preserving original features and avoiding pseudo-features.},

  abstract = {Personal protective equipment (PPE) refers to clothing and equipment designed to protect individuals from chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive hazards. The materials used to provide this protection may exacerbate thermal strain by limiting heat and water vapor transfer. Any new PPE must therefore be evaluated to ensure that it poses no greater thermal strain than the current standard for the same level of hazard protection. This review describes how such evaluations are typically conducted. Comprehensive evaluation of PPE begins with a biophysical assessment of materials using a guarded hot plate to determine the thermal characteristics (thermal resistance and water vapor permeability). These characteristics are then evaluated on a thermal manikin wearing the PPE, since thermal properties may change once the materials have been constructed into a garment. These data may be used in biomedical models to predict thermal strain under a variety of environmental and work conditions. When the biophysical data indicate that the evaporative resistance (ratio of permeability to insulation) is significantly better than the current standard, the PPE is evaluated through human testing in controlled laboratory conditions appropriate for the conditions under which the PPE would be used if fielded. Data from each phase of PPE evaluation are used in predictive models to determine user guidelines, such as maximal work time, work/rest cycles, and fluid intake requirements. By considering thermal stress early in the development process, health hazards related to temperature extremes can be mitigated while maintaining or improving the effectiveness of the PPE for protection from external hazards.},

  volume = {128},
  issn = {01650327},
  abstract = {Background: Few attempts have been made to integrate the known risk factors for combatrelated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) into a comprehensive model. This study investigated relative contributions of combat experiences, post-battle experiences, and perceptions of threat to post-deployment PTSD symptoms, and also examined whether predeployment preparedness moderated associations among these variables.
Methods: Two hundred seven troops deployed to the Middle East between 2001 and 2008 completed self-report measures. Data were analyzed using path analysis and regressions. A comprehensive model including additive effects, mediation, and moderation was examined.
Results: Perceptions of threat mediated the association of combat experiences with PTSD, but not that of post-battle experiences with PTSD. Sense of preparedness for deployment moderated the association of combat experiences with perceived threat, such that troops with low preparedness perceived high levels of threat regardless of combat exposure, whereas troops with high preparedness perceived levels of threat that were correlated with levels of combat. Limitations: Data were cross-sectional, all assessment was retrospective self-report, and the sample was primarily White, male, and married.
Conclusions: Combat and post-battle experiences appear linked to PTSD via separate pathways. Thus, PTSD prevention efforts may need to vary based on types of events experienced. Predeployment preparation mitigated perceived threat in the context of low combat exposure, but it did not moderate direct associations of risk factors with PTSD symptoms. Thus, predeployment training and preparation do not appear sufficient to protect against PTSD.},

This requires a significant coordination of actions, situational awareness, and fast decision-making. This paper focuses on modeling the collaboration acts among multiple combat units. We analyze the tactics of urban combat operations and then propose a general framework for modeling collaboration among units. Our approach uses Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) as a paradigm for modeling Command and Control (C2) in urban combat operations. We introduce the notion of scenario-based and policy-based MAS collaboration, and analyze different MAS inter-agent structural and control architectures, including hierarchical and federated architectures. This paper shows how scenario-based and policy-based collaboration matched with different MAS control architectures fits the C2 requirements of urban combat operations.},

  abstract = {Today's armed forces, which have a new perspective of combat, are trying to use high-end technologies to improve their capabilities especially in combat and asymmetric warfare. Complexity is the real word to define the future war environment, which will need information about multi dimensional needs. With a continuous increase in the complexity and tempo on the modern battlefield; new demands are placed on rapid and precise information dissemination. The volume of information available to the user becomes larger while the time necessary for correctly interpreting and understanding this information becomes prohibitively smaller. Not only from an informational view but also from other perspectives land combat may be described \textendash{} mathematically and physically \textendash{} as a nonlinear dynamical system composed of many interacting semi autonomous and hierarchically organized agent continuously adapting to a changing environment. From this point of view agent based structures are good suited for modeling and simulating complex adaptive systems. This paper proposes a two layer hybrid agent architecture to match the needs of future multi-dimensional warfare. This architecture has an integrated simulation tool to simulate planning results from the cognitive layer via reactive agents. Our work showed us that results gained from this architecture are valid in small unit combat.},

The engine model links the appropriate number of single-cylinder modules, featuring thermodynamic models of the in-cylinder processes with transient capabilities to ensure high fidelity predictions. A detailed fuel injection control module is also included. The engine is coupled to the driveline, which consists of the torque converter, transmission, differential and prop shaft and drive shafts. An enhanced version of the point mass model is used to account for vehicle dynamics in the longitudinal and heave directions. A vehicle speed controller replaces the operator and allows the feedforward simulation to follow a prescribed vehicle speed schedule. For the particular case reported here, the simulation is configured for the International 4700 series, Class VI, 4x2 delivery truck powered by a V8 turbocharged, intercooled diesel engine. The integrated vehicle simulation is validated against transient data measured on the proving ground. Comparisons of predicted and measured responses of engine and vehicle variables during vehicle acceleration from 0 to 60 mph and from 30 to 50 mph show very good agreement. The simulation is also used to study trade-offs involved in redesigning control strategies for improved performance of the vehicle system.},

  abstract = {Automation in point cloud data processing is central in knowledge discovery within decision-making systems. The definition of relevant features is often key for segmentation and classification, with automated workflows presenting the main challenges. In this paper, we propose a voxel-based feature engineering that better characterize point clusters and provide strong support to supervised or unsupervised classification. We provide different feature generalization levels to permit interoperable frameworks. First, we recommend a shape-based feature set (SF1) that only leverages the raw X, Y, Z attributes of any point cloud. Afterwards, we derive relationship and topology between voxel entities to obtain a three-dimensional (3D) structural connectivity feature set (SF2). Finally, we provide a knowledge-based decision tree to permit infrastructure-related classification. We study SF1/SF2 synergy on a new semantic segmentation framework for the constitution of a higher semantic representation of point clouds in relevant clusters. Finally, we benchmark the approach against novel and best-performing deep-learning methods while using the full S3DIS dataset. We highlight good performances, easy-integration, and high F1-score ({$>$} 85\%) for planar-dominant classes that are comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning.},

Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal. The suit resulted in several Justice Department internal reviews, two Congressional investigations, the appointment of a special counsel by Attorney General William P. Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel's report under Attorney General Janet Reno. Inslaw's claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court's ruling against Inslaw in 1998.
During the 12-year long legal proceedings, Inslaw accused the Department of Justice of conspiring to steal its software, attempting to drive it into Chapter 7 liquidation, using the stolen software for covert intelligence operations against foreign governments, and involvement in a murder. These accusations were eventually rejected by the special counsel and the Court of Federal Claims.},

They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times.

  abstract = {The Business Plot  was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States.  Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization with Butler as its leader and use it in a coup d'{\'e}tat to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1934, Butler testified before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities (the "McCormack\textendash{}Dickstein Committee") on these claims. No one was prosecuted.
At the time of the incidents, news media dismissed the plot, with a New York Times editorial characterizing it as a "gigantic hoax".  While historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually close to execution, most agree that some sort of plot was contemplated and discussed.},

  title = {Julius and {{Ethel Rosenberg}}},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were American citizens who spied on behalf of the Soviet Union and were tried, convicted, and executed by the federal government of the United States. They provided top-secret information about radar, sonar, and jet propulsion engines and were accused of transmitting valuable nuclear weapon designs; at that time the United States was the only country in the world with nuclear weapons.Other convicted co-conspirators were sentenced to prison, including Ethel's brother, David Greenglass (who had made a plea agreement), Harry Gold, and Morton Sobell. Klaus Fuchs, a German scientist working in Los Alamos, was convicted in the United Kingdom.For decades, the Rosenbergs' sons, Michael and Robert Meeropol, and many other defenders maintained that Julius and Ethel were innocent of spying on their country and were victims of Cold War paranoia. After the fall of the Soviet Union, much information concerning them was declassified, including a trove of decoded Soviet cables, code-named VENONA, which detailed Julius's role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets and Ethel's role as an accessory. In 2008 the National Archives of the United States published most of the grand jury testimony related to the prosecution of the Rosenbergs; it revealed that Ethel had not been directly involved in activities, contrary to the charges levied by the government. 
In 2014, five historians who had published works based on the Rosenberg case wrote that newly available Soviet documents show that Ethel Rosenberg hid money and espionage paraphernalia for Julius, served as an intermediary for communications with his Soviet intelligence contacts, relayed her personal evaluation of individuals whom Julius considered recruiting, and was present at meetings with his sources.
They support the assertion that Ethel persuaded her sister-in-law Ruth Greenglass to travel to New Mexico to recruit her brother David Greenglass as a spy.},

  title = {Marginal Distribution},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In probability theory and statistics, the marginal distribution of a subset of a collection of random variables is the probability distribution of the variables contained in the subset. It gives the probabilities of various values of the variables in the subset without reference to the values of the other variables. This contrasts with a conditional distribution, which gives the probabilities contingent upon the values of the other variables.
Marginal variables are those variables in the subset of variables being retained. These concepts are "marginal" because they can be found by summing values in a table along rows or columns, and writing the sum in the margins of the table. The distribution of the marginal variables (the marginal distribution) is obtained by marginalizing \textendash{} that is, focusing on the sums in the margin \textendash{} over the distribution of the variables being discarded, and the discarded variables are said to have been marginalized out.
The context here is that the theoretical studies being undertaken, or the data analysis being done, involves a wider set of random variables but that attention is being limited to a reduced number of those variables. In many applications, an analysis may start with a given collection of random variables, then first extend the set by defining new ones (such as the sum of the original random variables) and finally reduce the number by placing interest in the marginal distribution of a subset (such as the sum). Several different analyses may be done, each treating a different subset of variables as the marginal variables.},
